GNOME Power Manager is a session daemon that makes it easy to manage the
power on your laptop or desktop system.

This _unstable_ release contains lots of crazy new code since 2.23.1 was released. WARNING, this code may impregnate your cat called Dave and steal all of the magazines from the bathroom.

This stable release contains important fixes since 2.24.1 was released. Distributions should consider upgrading gnome-power-manager via errata packages if possible.

There are a few fixes focused on polishing for the new release.

- Done!

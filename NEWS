==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.4
==========

Released September xx, 2005

- We now have a YUM repo that contains all the needed updates for a FC4 system.
  You do not now have to update some of your fedora system to the unstable
  rawhide repo. All packages have been built by me for FC4.
- Comboboxes now only have "sane" values available.
- Lots more code cleanups, and more modularization.
- 100% GLIB DBUS support - this is faster than libhal, but has not been tested
  much, and is disabled for now. Use ./configure --enable-glibhal to test.
- DBUS services now works, so we init g-p-m with just a query to 
  org.gnome.GnomePowerManager. This makes it easy to make sure g-p-m has been
  started, or to start g-p-m when we start Power Preferences.
- Now we control GNOME Screensaver so that we don't use screensavers on battery
  but just blank the screen.
- Lots of updates to the website.
- Fixed specfile to be 100% RedHat approved format.
- Now we only call SetLowPower if system.formfactor is laptop.
- We detect GNOME Screensaver at runtime, rather than a configure option.

GNOME Power Manager 0.2.2
==========

Released September 07, 2005

- Fixed the problem where the notification icon wasn't being shown by default.
- We now check for the presence on the session and system dbus connections,
  and tell the user what they have to do, to fix the problem.
- New Polish translation by Micha≈Ç Kastelik
- Switch to using org.gnome.GnomePowerManager rather than net.sf.GnomePower
- Add the new DBUS api calls isOnBattery(), isOnUps(), and isOnAC() and 
  remove isRunningOnMains().
- LCD slider brightness now adjusts the correct immediate state whilst on 
  battery power and AC.
- Fix from wrobell to fix compilation on PLD Linux.
- Made docbook2man optional. If this program is missing, the man files will 
  not be built.	Suggested by Eugenia Loli-Queru to fix Arch Linux compilation.
- Add lots more answered questions on the FAQ page.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.1
==========

Released September 5, 2005

- The reboot and halt gconf typos have been fixed.
- Lots more code compliant with C99.
- gnome-power-manager now sports a --version argument.
- New Italian translation by Daniele Medri
- Fix a problem reported by Andrew Duggan where the incorrect ACPI reading was
  tripping up our over-zealous HAL checks.
- Rename LCDPanel to LaptopPanel to match HAL CVS. LCD brightness is
  officially supported now.
- Fix the combobox error for "Sleep Type"
- Website updated with a "bug reporting" section.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.0
==========

Released August 31, 2005

- This new release brings lots of new features and updated translations.
- The preferences program now supports LCD brightness, and works with 
  gnome-screensaver to set the DPMS timeout for monitors.
- The website has been updated with a new design with lots more content.
- *WARNING* this program depends on new DBUS and HAL libraries to install, 
  due to the recent changes in HAL. See the new FAQ page 
  (http://gnome-power.sourceforge.net/faq.php) for more details.
- Working with HAL 0.5.4, lots of problems have been solved.
- This includes the need for a external DBUS daemon - now we use HAL to 
  launch scripts.
- Many more batteries are supported, as well as support for most of the 
  broken ACPI BIOSes.
- This release has had little testing (and a *lot* has changed internally 
  since 0.1.0), so expect a few bugs, and teething problems.
- The wait between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 has been required for the newest HAL to be
  released. Expect more frequent releases in the future.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.8.2
==========

Released November xx, 2005

- Fix the tooltip so that we don't display "Unknown Remaining"
- Now align the menu to the bottom (or top) of the notification area like
  all the applets do.
- Update the website to be more GNOMEy, copied from the nautilus template.
- Lots of Makefile.am and configure tidy ups.
- We now don't assert for things not related to our internal state
- Removed gpm-dbus-test and made the DBUS interface *much* simpler
- Website is now hosted on gnome.org servers:
  http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnome-power-manager/

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.8.1
==========

Released October 25, 2005

- Fix a NULL pointer dereference where the remaining_time isn't known, and
  the battery is low.
- Don't crash when we do not have gnome-dev-memory in our theme.
- We now register the name of the application with the session-manager.
- Change HAL dep from 0.5.4 to 0.5.3 so we can build on Ubuntu Breezy.
  NOTE: There are *lots* of bugs in HAL 0.5.3 fixed in later releases.
- Now delete Makefile.in when doing maintainer-clean rather than distclean
  so we can build on Ubuntu Breezy.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.8
==========

Released October 17, 2005

- All source files are now fully documented with Doxygen.
  http://gnome-power.sourceforge.net/doxygen/
- Fixed problems with displaying the just the AC Adapter icon.
  Thanks to Dumitru Ciobarcianu for reporting the problem.
- Added desktop mode where icon is forced. Disabled by default.
  The icon handling logic is to be simplified in 0.2.10
- Fixed a fatal error where a NULL pointer was deferenced when removing
  AC Adaptor when icon was hidden.
- Lots of cosmetic fixes thanks to Wouter Bolsterlee.
- Add back the (now themed) icons to gnome-power-preferences.
- Add a new tool, gnome-power-info to display the p-m capabilities or your
  machine, and report details of your power hardware. More to come...
- Lots of cosmetic fixes from Wouter Bolsterlee.
- We now detect when HAL is restarted and warn the user accordingly.
- When setting the low battery and critical battery threholds, we now
  tell the user how much time they would have. This only works for ACPI
  when discharging, as HAL doesn't give us discharge data when charged.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.6
==========

Released October 01, 2005

- GNOME Screensaver support runtime detection has been improved
  (no timeouts now, and console messages supressed)
- Fixed lots of 64bit warnings thanks to Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>
- GNOME Power Manager is now in Fedora Core Rawhide!
- The screen now dims gently (rather than a big brightness change) when
  changing brightness states.
- We now support ONLY the new SetBrightness HAL API in HAL CVS.
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.hal/3280
  You will have to be using HAL CVS for brightness changing to work.
- We now do not require libhal as all communication to hald is done through
  the DBUS glib bindings.
- All source files now have lots of asserts that should make any code logic
  errors easy to spot. Please report any regressions.
- Thanks to Robert Love, we now daemonize when being run. Use --no-daemonise
  to disable this.
- A new "About" box that follows the GNOME HIG...
- A new "Information" tab that tells you a bit about your computers' power
  management capability. This is very young and will have much more
  information in the future about batteries, UPS's etc. Help welcome.
- Lots of fixes and improvements to the core code, with thanks to Theetjuh
  and Myk Melez for testing the code so well.
- GNOME Power Manager now notifies you your battery is low *and* how much time
  you have remaining. This fixes a regression from 0.2.2.
- Working with GNOME Screensaver, we now work out the idle time so we can
  suspend or hibernate in a period of keyboard and mouse in-activity. 
  The load value is also computed, so we can avoid sleeping when CPU 
  intensive programs are left running, e.g. kernel compiles or simulations.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.4
==========

Released September 21, 2005

- We now have an experimental yum repo that contains all the needed updates
  for a standard FC4 system.
  You do not now have to update your fedora system to the unstable
  rawhide repo. All packages have been built by me for FC4.
- Comboboxes now only have "sane" values available.
- Lots more code cleanups, and more modularization.
- 100% GLIB DBUS support - this is faster than libhal, but has not been tested
  much, and is disabled for now. Use ./configure --enable-glibhal to test.
- DBUS services now works, so we init g-p-m with just a query to 
  org.gnome.GnomePowerManager. This makes it easy to make sure g-p-m has been
  started, or to start g-p-m when we start Power Preferences.
- Now we control GNOME Screensaver so that we don't use screensavers on battery
  but just blank the screen.
- Lots of updates to the website.
- Fixed specfile to be in RedHat approved format.
- Now we only call SetLowPower if system.formfactor is laptop.
- We detect GNOME Screensaver at runtime, rather than with a configure option.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.2
==========

Released September 07, 2005

- Fixed the problem where the notification icon wasn't being shown by default.
- We now check for the presence on the session and system dbus connections,
  and tell the user what they have to do, to fix the problem.
- New Polish translation by Micha≈Ç Kastelik
- Switch to using org.gnome.GnomePowerManager rather than net.sf.GnomePower
- Add the new DBUS api calls isOnBattery(), isOnUps(), and isOnAC() and 
  remove isRunningOnMains().
- LCD slider brightness now adjusts the correct immediate state whilst on 
  battery power and AC.
- Fix from wrobell to fix compilation on PLD Linux.
- Made docbook2man optional. If this program is missing, the man files will 
  not be built.	Suggested by Eugenia Loli-Queru to fix Arch Linux compilation.
- Add lots more answered questions on the FAQ page.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.1
==========

Released September 5, 2005

- The reboot and halt gconf typos have been fixed.
- Lots more code compliant with C99.
- gnome-power-manager now sports a --version argument.
- New Italian translation by Daniele Medri
- Fix a problem reported by Andrew Duggan where the incorrect ACPI reading was
  tripping up our over-zealous HAL checks.
- Rename LCDPanel to LaptopPanel to match HAL CVS. LCD brightness is
  officially supported now.
- Fix the combobox error for "Sleep Type"
- Website updated with a "bug reporting" section.

==========
GNOME Power Manager 0.2.0
==========

Released August 31, 2005

- This new release brings lots of new features and updated translations.
- The preferences program now supports LCD brightness, and works with 
  gnome-screensaver to set the DPMS timeout for monitors.
- The website has been updated with a new design with lots more content.
- *WARNING* this program depends on new DBUS and HAL libraries to install, 
  due to the recent changes in HAL. See the new FAQ page 
  (http://gnome-power.sourceforge.net/faq.php) for more details.
- Working with HAL 0.5.4, lots of problems have been solved.
- This includes the need for a external DBUS daemon - now we use HAL to 
  launch scripts.
- Many more batteries are supported, as well as support for most of the 
  broken ACPI BIOSes.
- This release has had little testing (and a *lot* has changed internally 
  since 0.1.0), so expect a few bugs, and teething problems.
- The wait between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 has been required for the newest HAL to be
  released. Expect more frequent releases in the future.

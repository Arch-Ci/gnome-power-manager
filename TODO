TODO:

 * change api to include a "key" so we can use glib bindings?

 * Use gnome-screensaver (use DBUS) for idle time calculation

 * Use the callbacks in libnotify to do a "What's this?" type help prompt.

 * Fix sleep type so we know what to do.

 * All saved values in gconf should be in seconds, not minutes.

 * The hasBla gconf keys have to go. Calculate in g-p-p

 * depend on hal 0.5.4 and get rid of the !CVSHAL stuff

 * use hal for suspend and hinernate, and gconf for shutdown and restart

 * hal_device_get_int has to return success value (rather than data - pass this
   by ref)so we can test for: not exist(battery.charge_level.percentage)

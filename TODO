TODO:

 * Convert DBUS bits to glib bindings (wait for 0.35 to hit updates-released)
 * change api to include a "key" so we can use glib bindings.

 * Use gnome-screensaver (use DBUS) for idle time calculation

 * Use the callbacks in libnotify to do a "What's this?" type help prompt.

 * Convert to using http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDocUtilsMigrationHowTo
  - No documetation yet, so not a lot to translate.

 * Add back sleep type so we know what to do.

 * All saved values in gconf should be in seconds, not minutes.

 * The hasBla gconf keys have to go. DBUS is our friend here I think.

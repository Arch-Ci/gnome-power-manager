TODO:

 * Convert DBUS to glib bindings (wait for 0.35 to hit updates-released)

 * Use gnome-screensaver (use DBUS) for idle time calculation

 * Use gnome-screensaver to set dpms and screensave timouts via gconf keys
	if /apps/gnome-screensaver/dpms_enabled is false
	  hide options from user and explain why
	if true,
      set minutes in /apps/gnome-screensaver/dpms_off

 * Use the callbacks in libnotify to do a "What's this?" type help prompt.
  - Problem with sebfault in libnotify with this, bug sent upstream

 * Convert to using http://live.gnome.org/GnomeDocUtilsMigrationHowTo
  - No documetation yet, so not a lot to translate.

 * Add back sleep type so we know what to do.

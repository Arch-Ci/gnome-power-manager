TODO:

 * change api to include a "key" so we can use glib bindings?

 * Use gnome-screensaver (use DBUS) for idle time calculation

 * Use the callbacks in libnotify to do a "What's this?" type help prompt.

 * Fix sleep type so we know what to do.

 * All saved values in gconf should be in seconds, not minutes.

 * The hasBla gconf keys have to go. Calculate in g-p-p.
	NEARLY DONE. The hasBatteries logic in gpm-main has to be tidied up,
	but other wise is nearly there.

 * depend on hal 0.5.4 and get rid of the !CVSHAL stuff

 * use hal for suspend and hibernate, and gconf for shutdown and restart

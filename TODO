TODO:

 * change api to include a "key" so we can use glib bindings?

 * Use gnome-screensaver (use DBUS) for idle time calculation

 * Use the callbacks in libnotify to do a "What's this?" type help prompt.

 * Add back sleep type so we know what to do.

 * All saved values in gconf should be in seconds, not minutes.

 * The hasBla gconf keys have to go. DBUS is our friend here I think.

 * depend on hal 0.5.4 and get rid of the !CVSHAL stuff

 * use hal for suspend and hinernate, and gconf for shutdown and restart

2006-04-04  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: Add lot more content.

	* help/Makefile.am, help/C/figures/gs-prefs.png: Add this new file
	showing gnome-screensaver-preferences.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c (gpm_info_data_point_add): Check the end of the list
	not the start as the list is not appended to.

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c (gpm_graph_event_description): Mark the new
	strings as translatable.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/48x48/gpm-brightness.png, data/scalable/gpm-brightness.svg:
	Add the new icons from Diana Fong, many thanks.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.{c|h}: Add the legend facility for the graphs.

	* src/gpm-info.{c|h}: Move the graph and colour stuff to the graph
	widget, and add some more descriptions and colours.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add more event types that interest us.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Make shadow type "in" for the scrolled window.

	* data/gpm-info.glade, src/gpm-graph-widget.{c|h}:
	Rename the class to graph from simple_graph as it's not simple!

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.h, src/gpm-info.{c|h}, src/gpm-manager.c:
	Add the facility to add point in time of interest using the
	gpm_info_interest_point () function. These appear on the graph and act
	as a sort of visual indicator to how certain things save power.
	Only a few types are supported, and a legend is required.

	* src/gpm-power.c: (battery_device_cache_entry_update_key): Don't set
	the remaining time zero when we change change states.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c (gpm_info_data_point_add): change prev to next so that
	we remove the same number of points form the start of the list as from
	the end.

	* src/gpm-power.{c|h}: Remove ->rate and replace with ->rate_raw and
	->rate_smoothed as sometimes we want the exponentially averaged value
	for the time remaining, and sometimes the raw value for the graphs and
	info pages.

	* src/gpm-info.c (gpm_info_log_do_poll): Log the raw rather than the
	smoothed data points.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_properties_modified):
	Don't switch round the removed and added booleans, the order is
	"added" then "removed".

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_property_modified):
	Emit the signal for modified *or* new keys, not just modified keys.
	This fixes the problem where HAL is slow creating the keys, which can
	happen with the CSR mouse and keyboard addon. This is a HAL bug, but
	there's no reason we can't make the mice work after a little delay.

2006-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-feedback-widget.c (gpm_feedback_init): Not everybody installs
	the glade file to /home/hughsie.... so don't hardcode this. Ugh.
	Found by Alejandro Vera, many thanks.

2006-04-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-power.{c|h}: Add gpm_power_update_all so
	we update our caches when we resume from suspend or hibernate.

2006-04-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs-core.c, src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}, src/gpm-manager.c,
	src/Makefile.am: Use an instance of GpmScreensaver in g-p-p so we can
	connect to the g-s-p idle delay settings.
	Move the slider so that it starts at the g-s-p setting.
	Should fix #336061

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c (gpm_screensaver_connect,
	gpm_screensaver_enable_throttle): Cache the "throttle" value.
	This is needed if g-p-m is started before g-s; we apply the setting
	when g-s is eventually started. Fixes #332366

2006-04-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}, src/manager.c: Allow gnome-screensaver to
	connect and disconnect from the messagebus at runtime. This fixes
	the bug where gnome-screensaver is updated, and locking stops working.
	Using this method also stops us continually getting the GProxy and DBUS
	session connection for every call to gnome-screensaver and is more
	efficient.

2006-04-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}, src/manager.c: make gpm-screensaver into
	a module, so we can start to deal with the issues with restarting g-s
	and g-s starting after g-p-m.

2006-04-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs-core.{c|h}, src/gpm-prefs.c, src/Makefile.am:
	Modularize the key functionality into this new module, so we can
	start connecting it to other modules.
	We need tighter links with g-s if we are going to do clever things with
	the idle sliders.
	Also comment, and do a massive tidy-up.

2006-04-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c (gpm_power_get_description_array): Shorten desc.

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c (gpm_get_axis_label): Don't display "m"
	when we show hours.

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Set HScroll to auto as sometimes the info doesn't
	fit on my little iBook screen.

2006-03-31  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in, docs/Doxyfile.in, docs/.cvsignore, docs/Makefile.am:
	Remove the remains of doxygen support.

2006-03-31  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-feedback-widget.c: Change timeout to be one second so it
	matches the volume widget.

2006-03-31  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-brightness.{c|h}, src/gpm-marshall.list:
	Emit a signal when we are stepped up or down, catch this signal and
	show the new feeback widget.

	* src/gpm-feedback-widget.c: Do some simple refcounting on the timeouts
	so we only close the widget on the last timeout.

	* data/icons/48x48/Makefile.am, data/icons/48x48/gpm-brightness.png, 
	src/gpm-stock-icons.h:
	Add this new file as a logo for the brightness popup. Waiting for a new
	SVG from Diana at the moment, so I've re-used the old g-s-d one.

2006-03-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-feedback-widget.{c|h}, src/Makefile.am, src/gpm-manager.c:
	Add new class for a feedback widget just like gnome-settings-daemon
	used to do. This still needs to be tied up into the lcd events and
	also needs to be made sane. Make no comment yet, it's all unfinished.

	* data/gpm-feedback-widget.glade, data/Makefile.am: Add the UI, taken
	from the acme part of gnome-settings-daemon.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add these new files to be translated.

2006-03-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* man/gnome-power-manager.sgml: Apply patch from Ow Mun Heng
	<nikeow@yahoo.com> to add the --daemon option. Many thanks.

2006-03-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c: Make sure the labels are centered, and also
	that the grid is even. Also make the text consistent and shorter.

	* src/gpm-power.c: Factor out the exponential average so it's clearer
	what we are trying to achieve.

2006-03-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h: Add
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/rate_exponential_average_factor so that we
	can play with the rate smoothing code, and temporarily disable it when
	we profile/play-with the battery.
	Also fix a typo in the spec to fix #336603.

	* src/gpm-power.{c|h}, src/gpm-brightness.{c|h},
	src/gpm-networkmanager.{c|h}:Add a few comments to make things
	clearer for me. I like comments.

2006-03-27  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Make the 3rd tab "Power", not "Rate".

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c: Make the Y axis "W" rather than "Wh" as we
	are projecting power over time rather than rate over time.

2006-03-27  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Change info layout to be vertical
	in a scrolled window instead of 2x2 so that it doesn't get
	too wide.  Fixes #336207.

2006-03-27  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_suspend, gpm_manager_hibernate):
	Add a call to sync_dpms_policy () so we can recover the DPMS settings
	after a suspend or hibernate.
	Should fix #336081

2006-03-27  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/icons/Makefile.am: Add gtk-update-icon-cache when we install.
	Should fix #336067

2006-03-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Add el and ka that got missed from this file.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add missing files.

	* po/*.po: Do a intltool-update --pot && make update-po to
	freshen up the translations.

2006-03-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_set_image_from_stock),
	src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_action_combo),
	src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init),
	src/gpm-main.c (main):
	Use gpm_critical_error with a descriptive report rather than g_error.

2006-03-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-debug.c, src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Add a few
	comments to make things clearer for me.

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_set_image_from_stock):
	Unref the icon so we don't waste memory.

	* src/gpm-debug.c: Move gpm_critical_error() here so we can start
	warning for other stuff too, rather than just g_error'ing. I'm trying
	to reduce the number of bugzilla's I get.

2006-03-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-main.c (gpm_object_register): Remove DBUS < 0.61
	compatibility ifdefs as we now require DBUS 0.61.

2006-03-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/icons/scalable/*: Add the svg icons.

	* data/icons/48x48/*, configure.in, data/icons/Makefile.am: Add this
	new directory with the few 24x24 icons we need.

	* data/icons/16x16/Makefile.am, data/icons/24x24/Makefile.am:
	Install these icons to /usr/share/icons/hicolor as we now need icons of
	different sizes, that we also need to use external to the application
	in libnotify. This also makes theming trivial as the current icons
	will be used by redhat in the bluecurve theme when we switch to tango.
	This means you have to install the icons to hicolor, and then do:
	gtk-update-icon-cache -q /usr/share/icons/hicolor

	* data/gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Update the icon cache so we can
	get the new icons registered.

	* data/icons/Makefile.am, src/gpm-stock-icons.h: Don't ship
	gnome-power.png, but instead ship an application icon in each size.

	* data/icons/16x16/gpm-power-information.png: Remove, as now we can
	use GTK_STOCK_INFO which is pretty much the same icon.

	* src/gpm-info.c, src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Set the window
	icons with the new icon locations.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Use all the new 48x48 icons for the libnotify
	dialogues.

	* src/gpm-stock-icons.c: Trim down to just the two s-t-d and s-t-r
	icons, as the others we can use as named icons.

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_set_image_from_stock): Open from
	the theme, rather than the stock set.

2006-03-25  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Change "Running on Battery" and "Running on AC"
	labels inside the tab to "Sleep" as they are already on the tabs. 
	Add a Brightness label to the brightness sliders. Fixes bug #335991
	Change all the widget names to *battery* i.s.o. *batteries*
	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Update because of changes in gpm-prefs.glade and some
	refactoring

2006-03-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/icons/svg/*: Remove, as directory name is incorrect.

	* data/icons/{16x16|24x24}/*, src/gpm-manager.c:
	Make all icons prefix with gpm-*

2006-03-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-tray-icon.{c|h}:
	Make the order of the arguments to the icon message sane, and
	consistent thoughout g-p-m. Also add in the urgency field, and mark
	each notification with it's type, e.g. GPM_NOTIFY_URGENCY_CRITICAL
	for the critical action notification, as now libnotify changes it's
	message side colour depending on the urgency level.
	Also start adding in functionality so we change the icon in the
	libnotify window, but for now default to our application icon.

2006-03-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c, configure.in, data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in:
	Remove the configure option ACTIONS_MENU_ENABLED and replace with the
	gconf key /apps/gnome-power-manager/show_actions_in_menu so that we
	can change the behaviour at runtime, rather than having to recompile.
	This defaults to true, where the actions are listed in the menu.
	Fixes #335415.

2006-03-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_get_warning_type): Don't return
	GPM_WARNING_ACTION when the battery value is 0% as this *may* happen
	with broken acpi laptops. Instead warn on the console.

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_device_cache_entry_update_key):
	Invalidate the rate when we are declared charging/discharging. This
	was noticed with the new graphs were static at non zero when charged.

2006-03-25  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-prefs.c: Use g_option i.s.o. popt

2006-03-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* CodingStyle: Remove as not required and out of date.

	* SConstruct, sconstools/*: Remove alternate build system while we
	consider alternatives.

2006-03-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-idle.{c|h}: Comment the file, and also get rid of the ugly
	cpudata struct. Make things a bit more friendly so people understand
	what's going on.

2006-03-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c: Comment the file, and also remember to g_slice_free
	the elements when we strip the data when we have too many points.

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.{c|h}: Apply a patch from Crispin Flowerday
	<crispin@gnome.org> to fix the expose event handling. Many thanks.
	Add correct licensing and copyright header to file.
	Also add comments to the functions, so I know what's happening where.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Remove oodles of trailing whitespace.

2006-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c: Use the new g_slice functions to allocate and
	deallocate the small chucks of memory.

2006-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: As things are getting complicated now, comment
	each function using gtkdoc format. I don't intend on generating gtkdoc
	output, I want it for my own understanding.

2006-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-brightness.c, src/gpm-dbus-monitor.c, src/gpm-dpms-x11.c,
	src/gpm-hal-monitor.c, src/gpm-idle.c, src/gpm-info.c,
	src/gpm-inhibit.c, src/gpm-power.c, src/gpm-tray-icon.c:

	From a suggestion from Paolo Borelli <pborelli@katamail.com>, more
	details available on #335369.

	Remove the parent_class declaration and the peek_parent() function call
	and replace all the uses of parent_class with gpm_x_parent_class.

2006-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in, src/gpm-tray-icon.c, data/gnome-power-manager.spec.in:
	Enable the experimental features, these belong in 2.15.x

2006-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.15.0

2006-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c: Apply a fix from Ray Strode to fix the [x] close
	behaviour of the info window. Many thanks.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.{c|h}, src/gpm-info.c: Spend another two hours
	on these files, to get rid of the list-allocation, and make it work ok.
	Still some funnies, but I'm working on those.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c, src/gpm-manager.c, configure.in: Drop support
	for < DBUS 0.61 as we need the new 0.61 API calls, and also we can
	get rid of some compatability cruft.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c, configure.in: Drop support for libnotify 0.2.x
	and depend on version 0.3.0 -- to do cool stuff we need to use the new
	glib api.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c, configure.in: Make cairo required, rather
	than an optional module.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}: Don't inhibit, just
	throttle. Pointed out in #332576.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Use the button "battery" rather than "www" to show
	the battery status. This depends on mjg59's kernel addition and the
	use of a HAL with the new button patched in.

2006-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c: Make data go to the right graph.

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c: Make sure both 0% and 100% are within the
	black outline box.

	* src/gpm-stock-icons.{c|h}, src/gpm-manager,
	data/icons/24x24/battery-broken.png, data/icons/24x24/ups-broken.png:
	Add broken battery icons so we can easily get bug reports from broken
	hardware. At the moment we just show 0% charging, which is interpreted
	as "g-p-m gets the value wrong" rather than "the hardware is broken".

2006-03-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-preferences.desktop.in: Apply patch from
	Vincent Fretin <vincent.fretin@gmail.com> to add X-GNOME-Bugzilla keys
	for use with bug buddy.
	Category "Application" is not a freedesktop.org registred category and
	should be removed.

2006-03-21  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c (gpm_screensaver_lock):
	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_blank_screen): added debug messages
	for error conditions.

2006-03-20  JP Rosevear <jpr@novell.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c: fixed response to HAL stops/restarts.
	(watch_device_disconnect_condition,
	watch_device_disconnect_proxy_modified, watch_device_remove): removed.
	(watch_remove_battery): disconnect from signals and free removed
	data from the hash table.

2006-03-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.{c|h}: Remove the DBUS n-o-c functionality.

	* src/gpm-dbus-monitor.{c|h}, src/Makefile.am, src/gpm-marshall.list:
	Add these files as this functionality has been refactored from
	gpm-hal-monitor.
	Add the facility to monitor session name-owner-change as well as
	system, as we need this for the auto-remove inhibits when the caller
	crashes or forgets to remove the inhibit request.

	* src/gpm-inhibit.{c|h}: Add gpm_inhibit_remove_dbus which does a
	forced removal if already existing in the inhibit database.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Watch the session dbus, and call
	gpm_inhibit_remove_dbus when a application quits from the session bus.

	* src/gpm-power.{c|h}: Proxy the dbus n-o-c, so we can deal with hal's
	disappearance from the system bus like we used to.

2006-03-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h: Rework the key
	names a little, so they are in the same area in gconf.

	* data/gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Build the experimental stuff.

2006-03-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h: Add:
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_low_percentage
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_very_low_percentage
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_critical_percentage
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_action_percentage
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_low_time
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_very_low_time
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_critical_time
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/battery_action_time
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/laptop_panel_dim_brightness

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Read in the values set in gconf
	so that we can change the hardcoded values if required. Fixes a problem
	reported by Ralf Mörler, where the battery critical was set impossibly
	low. Also get the LCD brightness on idle from gconf, as we are in the
	area, and might want to be tweaked by distros/users.

2006-03-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-inhibit.{c|h}: Add gpm_inhibit_check() so we can see if it's
	okay to do the action. Also add gpm_inhibit_get_message() to get a
	full description of why the action was inhibited.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add a helper function,
	gpm_manager_is_inhibit_valid () that checks validity, and shows a
	libnotify type window explaining the problem. Add this helper where we
	currently use gpm_manager_is_policy_timout_valid(), except the low
	power battery condition which must be done regardless of any veto.

2006-03-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.{c|h}, docs/dbus-interface.txt, src/gpm-manager.xml,
	src/Makefile.am: Update with the new code for the inhibit action.

	* src/gpm-inhibit.{c|h}, docs/dbus-test-inhibit.py: Add these new files
	so we can start to write the inhibit framework further described in
	#334809. InhibitInactiveSleep and AllowInactiveSleep work, but don't
	do anything in the current setup. More to come...

2006-03-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.{c|h}, docs/dbus-interface.txt, src/gpm-manager.xml:
	Add templates of InhibitInactiveSleep and AllowInactiveSleep to begin
	to add support for #334809. At the moment they don't do much.

2006-03-16  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade, src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_create): Add a
	"Running on UPS" tab so we can start to add some policy actions.
	Only show when UPS hardware is detected.

2006-03-14  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.14.1

2006-03-14  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	==== Version 2.14.0 ====

2006-03-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h: Add
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/policy_suppression_timeout so we can start to
	ignore events after we have returned from suspend/hibernate.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_is_policy_timout_valid): Add
	functionality so we can ignore events from resume.
	This is adapted from the ubuntu mega-patch by Daniel Silverstone.
	This should fix rh:185273.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_has_batteries): Only match primary batteries.
	This is to fix the battery tab appearing when a CSR mouse is inserted.

2006-03-12  Dennis Cranston  <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade:  HIG fixes:  spacing and capitalization

2006-03-12  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: (battery_status_changed_primary) Remove unecessary
	if statement

2006-03-12  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: Remove trailing whitespace throughout
	the file.
	Also add a description of suspend and hibernate. Fixes lp:34153.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add gpm-info.{c|h} and gpm-info.glade.
	Thanks to Marcel Telka for the email.

	* src/gpm-power.c (gpm_power_get_description_array): Add another
	description "lion" to the translation table. Thanks to Fabian Zeindl.

2006-03-11  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Fix ups frame name.

	* src/gpm-power.c: Add an enumeration for the unit for each device,
	as it makes sense to show some values for each unit type and not others

	* src/gpm-power.c: Begin the translate the technology field into known
	parameters.
	Ultimately we can feed this information back to HAL, so that hal has a
	fixed list of types (e.g. "fuel-cell", "lithium", "lead", or "nickel")
	that it can report as part of the spec. At the moment it's just
	displaying the internal ACPI name which is varied between manufacturers.

	* src/gpm-power.c: Don't calculate capacity when the last_full is equal
	to the design value as this just computes useless information.

2006-03-11  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c: Better describe capacity, and mark new strings as
	translatable.

2006-03-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Remove policy for desktops key,
	it was just working round missing preferences and nobody knew how to
	change the value to do what it should do.

	* src/gpm-prefs.(h|c) (setup_icon_policy): Use a key radio button,
	"Display when battery present" and connect to GUI.
	Restore the old text for always as it better reflects what the icon
	policy is. I know we have lots of options now, but people all want
	different things, and distros keep changing the defaults :-)

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id): make logic more sane by using the
	new "present" key value. Fixes lp:33388

2006-03-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c, src/gpm-power.{c|h}: Add capacity, vendor, model,
	serial number, technology and product into the device information
	fields. We get this from HAL when the device is added or coldplugged.

	* src/gpm-hal.c: Make the missing keys warning a bit quieter.

2006-03-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c: Do some fixing, and make autoupdate.

2006-03-09  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Add some information treeviews.

	* src/gpm-info.c: Create a treeview for each device type so we can
	display detailed information for each device instance. They need some
	fixing and love, but I can do that later. They also don't autoupdate.

	* src/gpm-power.{c|h}: Add gpm_power_get_num_devices_of_kind,
	gpm_power_free_description_array, gpm_power_get_description_array
	so we can get the detailed information for each device, rather than
	per class.

2006-03-08  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Add the rate and time remaining tabs that use
	the new graphs. These maybe too much in the UI, but seeing as we get
	them for free I guess they can't hurt. And they'll be usefull for
	debugging odd machines.

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.{c|h}: Allow the axes to be changed, and expose
	these as part of the public API. Also make sure that lines stay within
	the bounding box.

	* src/gpm-info.c: Add in infrastructure so we can monitor more than one
	data source, and display on multiple graphs. Loads of fixes, additional
	comments and cleanups. Also use the new window 16x16 icon.

2006-03-08  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/icons/16x16/gnome-power-manager.png: Add this small icon so we
	can use it for the window icon for the g-p-p and "About" windows.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Use the new 16x16 window icon.
	Fixes #333675.

2006-03-07  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Don't use mnemonics in notebook labels.
	Rename second tab to "Charge History".  Use HIG border spacing.

2006-03-07  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Check for cairo. This is an optional dependency if you
	want to build the experimental graph support.

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Don't set the size of the graph in the glade
	file, instead use the source.

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.c: Add the patch from Alexander Larsson so we
	don't antialias the gridlines. Also do lots of misc fixes to make this
	grid-thing work as it should.

	* src/gpm-info.c: Make some more stuff generic, and make the graph
	update every hardware interval. Also free our dynamically allocated
	memory when the [x] is clicked.

	This means that is you compile with --enable-experimental-features
	then you will get the graph. Do not do this on production systems as
	it's crashed once or twice, probably has spelling errors, and certainly
	the glade file could do with some HIG love. But it looks way cool.

2006-03-07  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-graph-widget.{c|h}, src/Makefile.am: Add a simple graph
	widget drawn using cairo. Disabled by default so we can build on FC4.
	This is for #333146 so we can draw cool graphs of power stuff. It's all
	very simple now, but the framework is very easy to expand.

	* src/gpm-info.c: Load the custom widget.

	* data/gpm-info.glade: Use the correct creation function name.

2006-03-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: s/Options/General for the third tab option.

2006-03-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-idle.{c|h}: Whitespace fixes.

	* src/gpm-info.{c|h}, src/Makefile.am: Add the beginnings of a
	logging and statistics module.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Initialise and finalise the info module.

	* data/gpm-info.glade, data/Makefile.am: Add the outline information UI,
	showing batteries status, UPS's status, and the various charging graphs.
	This does not work correctly yet. And you can only activate this new UI
	with the experimental compile option as it's buggy, and nothing really
	works how it should yet.

2006-03-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Add the information icon if
	experimental-features is enabled in configure. Currently it just
	sends a signal to the manager.

	* data/icons/16x16/power-information.png, data/icons/16x16/Makefile.am,
	src/gpm-stock-icons.{c|h}: Add this icon for the power information item.

2006-03-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (power_button_pressed_cb, power_on_ac_changed_cb):
	Poke the screensaver to simulate user input. This is what Windows XP
	does, and should solve the problems with the timer event happening
	shortly after the ac_adapter is removed. See #333525 for details.

2006-03-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Add the --enable-experimental-features flag so that
	I can start putting cool new (unfinished) stuff into CVS, such as
	#326741 and #333146

2006-03-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal.c (gpm_hal_handle_error): Create this function, and use
	it for all the HAL error handling. This lets us do clever things like
	ignoring DBUS timeouts. Original patch from Ray Strode, many thanks.

2006-03-05  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_show): gtk_widget_unrealize the
	icon when we hide it, else it leaves a 1px line on the notification
	tray. Fixes uses gnome-power-manager when using a transparent panel.
	Fixes #333515.

2006-03-05  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c (gpm_screensaver_lock): Don't try to lock if
	gnome-screensaver is not running or not installed as we not retry
	50 times, which delays the suspend.

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.13.94

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	==== Version 2.13.93 ====

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (idle_changed_cb): Really ignore idle state changes
	when the lid is shut, so we don't turn on the display.

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (power_button_pressed_cb): Support the new names
	for brightness up and brightness down as the HAL API has changed.
	NOTE: we also support the old names, and should remove the *_DUP
	defines when we depend on HAL 0.5.8.

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Get the DBUS version, as now we have do stuff
	differently depending on whether we are using dbus 0.60 or dbus 0.61.
	Yay. I love API breakages. Sjoerd Simons found the bug, did the
	research, found the solution, and wrote a patch to fix, for which I
	thank him greatly:

	In dbus <= 0.60 dbus struct weren't really typed from dbus-glib's pov.
	In dbus >= 0.61 they are, so when defining a signal you need to be
	more precise then before.

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_connect_property_modified):
	get the correct struct type if we are using >= DBUS 0.61.

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_status_changed_primary): Remove the extra
	return that sneaked in to the notification path. This caused people to
	get repeated "battery is fully charged" messages if thier hardware was
	a little wonky.	Should fix lp:32650 and rh:183612

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (libnotify_event, gpm_tray_icon_notify): set
	the timeout parameter unit to be seconds, so we can still work with
	the old (ms) and new (s) libnotify versions.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: convert all the users of gpm_tray_icon_notify
	to send timeouts in seconds, and also define the defines
	GPM_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_LONG (20 seconds) and GPM_NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_SHORT
	(5 seconds) so we can change the values to a sensible default in one
	place only. Should start to fix lp:33411.

2006-03-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add ACTION_INTERACTIVE and GPM_PREF_BUTTON_POWER.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (manager_policy_do): Add a ACTION_INTERACTIVE
	handler so we can show the logout box by doing an interactive logout.

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/action_button_power so we can reconfigure
	the power button. This was a requested function by email, and makes
	sense, as it allows me to reconfigure my powerbook power button to
	suspend, as I only have the one button. Defaults to interactive, which
	is what we have now. Also add the extended description to the other
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/action_button_* keys.

2006-03-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.{c|h} (gpm_power_battery_is_charged): Create this new
	function so we can put all the logic to determine if the battery is
	charged in one place, as now sometimes the icon and the tooltip
	disagree. Should fix bug #333169

	* src/gpm-power.c (power_get_summary_for_battery_kind): Use the new
	gpm_power_battery_is_charged functionality so that we match the logic
	used for the icon.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id_helper): Use the new
	gpm_power_battery_is_charged functionality that we have abstracted out.

2006-03-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_kind_cache_update): clamp the percentage
	charge to between 0..100 as sometimes we get the internally averaged
	and computed value wrong. I blame HAL, but this fixes the problem. :-)

2006-03-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}: Add the functions:
	gpm_screensaver_inhibit_activation() and
	gpm_screensaver_allow_activation ().

	* src/gpm-manager.c (lid_button_pressed): Inhibit activation of the
	screensaver when the lid is closed, and allow activation when the
	lid is opened. This prevents the screensaver starting when the panel
	is closed, and the action is to turn off the screen or do nothing.

2006-03-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in, icons/Makefile.am, icons/16x16/*: Move the
	suspend-to-disk and suspend-to-ram icons to a proper place, considering
	they are not 24x24. Also update with the new bluecurve icons from
	Diana Fong, to match the theme, many thanks. Fixes #332631.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Ignore timeout events when the lid is closed,
	as the DPMS is already off, and we don't want to perform policy actions
	or re-enable the screen when the user moves the mouse on systems that
	do not support hardware blanking.
	Details are here: https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/22522

2006-03-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (gpm_critical_error): Create this function and use it
	in main to deal with critical warnings for missing dbus. I probably get
	one bug report a week of g-p-m "crashing" on startup where the dbus
	system or session server is missing. Display a BIG FAT warning in a
	message box with all the details and exit nicely with error code 1.

006-03-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c (gpm_screensaver_lock): When we send the Lock
	signal to g-ss it takes maybe a second or so to fade the screen and
	lock. If we suspend mid fade then on resume the X display is still
	present for a split second (since fade is gamma) and as such it can
	leak information. Instead we wait until g-ss reports running and thus
	blanked solidly before we continue from the screensaver_lock action.
	The interior of g-ss is async, so we cannot get the dbus method to
	block until lock is complete. From the ubuntu mega-patch, thanks to
	Daniel Silverstone for the help explaining the situation.

2006-02-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Add an option to disable the dim on idle as I
	needed to change this during a demo today, and I had to grapple with
	gconf. Also change the always icon option to "Always display icon when
	battery present" as this represents better what it does.

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: remove duplicate lock option.

2006-02-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Make the logging interface a whole lot more sane
	without just poking around in the manager->priv struct.

	* src/gpm-manager.h, src/gpm-manager.h: Change the dbus method names to
	include xxxx_dbus_method so we know (for logging purposes) whether a
	suspend was triggered from the external method, or if we did it
	internally from one of the handlers.

2006-02-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-debug.{c|h}: Get rid of the to_file stuff, nobody ever used
	it, me included. Add functionality to log to syslog, to try and start
	to fix #332760. Also reformat file and make more structured.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Use define names to hold the key names, in case
	they ever change in HAL. Which they might do, when we start adding
	a few more.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Start to add a logging interface so that we can
	log *why* a specific action was taken, to also try to fix #332760.
	This needs to be expanded, giving values and more precise reasons.
	Log to syslog, so that we get messages such as:
	"Feb 28 19:19:07 localhost gnome-power-manager: Suspending system
	because user clicked suspend in tray menu" in /var/log/messages.
	This should help debugging all those weird bugzillas.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_button_pressed): Display a libnotify
	window containing all the device charges when the user presses the
	battery status key. From the ubuntu mega-patch.

2006-02-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add GPM_PREF_BUTTON_HIBERNATE

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add the new key:
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/action_button_hibernate so we can set the
	policy when the hibernate button is pressed. Defaults to hibernate.
	From the ubuntu mega-patch.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (callback_gconf_key_changed): Do instant apply for
	CAN_SUSPEND and CAN_HIBERNATE. From the ubuntu mega-patch.

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.{c|h}, src/gpm-marshal.list, src/gpm-power.{c|h}
	The battery name, details mess should not be emitted internally, as we
	should do all this processing in the hal-monitor. Get rid of the
	details field, and make this from VOID__STRING_STRING_BOOLEAN to
	VOID__STRING_BOOLEAN.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (power_button_pressed_cb): get rid of the "virtual"
	mess as the only thing to use it is my toshiba addon, which now does
	the button events a standard way.

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_condition): Do not filter the
	allowed buttons here, as we are currently doing it in two places.
	It make more sense for the manager to do it.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_status_changed_primary): Don't do the
	notification if the message is blank. From the ubuntu mega-patch.

	* src/gpm-hal.c (gpm_hal_num_devices_of_capability_with_value): Fix
	theoretical NULL dereference. From the ubuntu mega-patch.

2006-02-27  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id_helper): use the prefix, rather than
	hardcoding "battery" for the charged icon. Fixes #332761.

2006-02-27  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* data/Makefile.am: install autostart files to new (definitive) place.

2006-02-27  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_low_get_title): Include GPM_WARNING_ACTION
	to fix a crash when a very low power (0%) mouse is inserted. This
	should fix RH#183127.

2006-02-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.13.93

2006-02-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	==== Version 2.13.92 ====

2006-02-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_status_changed_primary): Only set the
	last_primary_percentage_change after we have tested for the transition.

2006-02-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add GPM_PREF_USE_ICON_DESKTOPS

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add the new key:
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/use_icon_for_desktops so we can set the icon
	policy when no hardware is present. Defaults to false.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id): Only use the ac_adapter fallback on
	desktops if GPM_PREF_USE_ICON_DESKTOPS is set. Fixes #332407

2006-02-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id_helper): Fix another broken laptop.

2006-02-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (libnotify_event): Fix typo for libnotify 0.3.0

2006-02-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/icons/24x24/*.png, data/icons/svg/*.png,
	src/gpm-stock-icons.{c|h}, src/gpm-tray-icon.c, src/gpm-manager.c:
	Add the following icons:

	ac-adapter, keyboard-power-low, mouse-power-low
	suspend-to-disk, suspend-to-ram

	battery-charged, battery-charging-xxx, battery-discharging-xxx
	ups-charged, ups-charging-xxx, ups-discharging-xxx

	Where:
	00-10%  = 000
	10-30%  = 020
	30-50%  = 040
	50-70%  = 060
	70-90%  = 080
	90-100% = 100

	To rationise our icon naming and make the icon selection *much easier*.
	This is to address bug #331117 to add new UPS discharging and charging
	icons, and also to start to fix #331761 so we can theme the icons
	someday soon. I wanted to do this before the release so we can start
	working on a default theme.

2006-02-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Fix the not on AC logic as
	we don't want to be notified on coldplug, but do want to be notified
	when we remove the ac_adpter for the first time.
	This should fix #332322

2006-02-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add GPM_PREF_IDLE_DIM_SCREEN.

	* src/gpm-brightness.c (gpm_brightness_percent_to_hw): Factor out the
	percent to hardware value calculation so we can do the error checking
	in one place.

	(gpm_brightness_level_dim_hw): Factor out the step dimming
	functionality so we can use it from other places.

	* src/gpm-brightness.{h|c} (gpm_brightness_level_save,
	gpm_brightness_level_resume): Add functionality so we can save the
	lcd brightness state and resume it from the manager.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (idle_changed_cb): Add in functionality so that we
	dim the screen to 30% when the SESSION is idle. Fixes #328564

2006-02-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add the new keys:
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/check_type_cpu and
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/check_type_net to set the system policy for
	idle check action on CPU load. Defaults to true.

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add GPM_PREF_IDLE_CHECK_CPU and
	GPM_PREF_IDLE_CHECK_NET.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): set the idle cpu load policy
	at init time. These policy keys should probably be updated while
	running, but this isn't important for now.

	* src/gpm-idle.c (poll_system_timer): only inhibit if we are set to
	check the CPU load. Networking to come.
	Fixes #332149

2006-02-24  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c (gpm_screensaver_lock)
	(gpm_screensaver_poke): Update for revised
	gnome-screensaver DBUS method capitalization.
	Fixes #332481

2006-02-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (power_on_ac_changed_cb): Invalidate the warning
	levels for primary battery when the AC is removed. NOTE: we still rely
	on the battery to begin discharging before we issue the warning in
	case our power source is UPS.
	Should fix #332322.

2006-02-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add the new key:
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/use_time_for_policy to set the policy for
	per-time or per-percentage critical and low power actions.

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add GPM_PREF_USE_TIME_POLICY

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): set the per-time policy type
	from GPM_PREF_USE_TIME_POLICY. This still needs to be documented.
	Fixes #332055.

2006-02-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add the new key:
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/notify_hal_error to set the policy for HAL
	failure notifications. Default true to display.

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Add GPM_PREF_NOTIFY_HAL_ERROR

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_hibernate, gpm_manager_suspend):
	Only display the "HAL failed to {action}" if set in gconf.
	Fixes #332440.

2006-02-23 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Make the descriptions of the
	gconf values better

2006-02-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml, help/Makefile.am,
	help/figures/gpm-prefs-ac.png, help/figures/gpm-prefs-battery.png,
	help/figures/gpm-prefs-options.png:
	Update the screenshots now we have updated the UI.

2006-02-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	src/gpm-manager.c (manager_critical_action_do): Do the critical action
	as part of a g_timeout, rather than a just a delay so we don't lock
	the GUI. Fixes #332150

	src/gpm-manager.c (battery_status_changed_primary): Describe what we
	are going to do better, so we don't say we are going to shutdown when
	we just are going to hibernate.

2006-02-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Remove notification-daemon as a req
	so that we can build on FC5.

2006-02-22  Crispin Flowerday  <gnome@flowerday.cx>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade:

	Alter some mnemonics to avoid conflicts with
	Ctrl+C (fixes bug #332192)

2006-02-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_condition): Fix detection
	of button objects, and add a verbose comment explaining what's going
	on. Fixes http://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/
	gnome-power-manager/+bug/32447

2006-02-22 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: "Running on Batteries" => "Running on battery"
	So we are consistent with the name of the tab
	"Notification Area" => "Notification area"
	HIG recommends Sentence capitalization

2006-02-21 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: refactor the code that disables widgets if a gconf
	key is not writable

2006-02-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.13.92

2006-02-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	==== Version 2.13.91 ====

2006-02-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	src/gpm-manager.c (lid_button_pressed): Keep track of the lid state
	internally in the manager state.

	(power_on_ac_changed_cb): We do the lid close on battery action if
	the ac_adapter is removed when the laptop is closed and on battery.
	This should fix (#331655).

	(battery_low_get_title): Changed "Power Warning" to "Power Information"
	for the title when the ac_adapter is removed. Fixes (#331865).

2006-02-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_sleep_slider,
	gpm_prefs_setup_brightness_slider, gpm_prefs_setup_action_combo,
	setup_icon_policy): Make the widgets disabled if the gconf key is
	not writeable. Fixes bug (#327893)

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: document why the widgets might be
	disabled.

2006-02-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: document the problems with
	Suspend on low power in a new known-bugs section.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (setup_battery_actions): Add back option
	ACTION_SUSPEND by popular request (#330267)

2006-02-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: document
	/apps/gnome-power-manager/lock_use_* to fix bug #331717.
	Also tidy up this document so it can be easily changed in the future.

2006-02-19 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, data/gpm-prefs.glade: remove suspend button action
	from the GUI

2006-02-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in, SConstruct, docs/Makefile.am: Remove doxygen build
	support as hardly any files now build. Fixes #327743.

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h,
	src/gpm-manager.c: Only use lock_on_blank_screen, lock_on_suspend,
	lock_on_hibernate as this should give us enough power for custom users
	and also simplicity so we don't have a dozen keys. We default to
	gnome-screensaver settings.

2006-02-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_status_changed_primary): Ahh! Merged a
	previous version of the (! on_ac) -> (! on_ac) patch. Fixed now.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_popup_cleared_cd): Add this
	function so we re-enable the tooltip.
	(gpm_tray_icon_button_press_cb): Disable the tooltip.
	(gpm_tray_icon_constructor): Set up the callback for the tray hide
	event. This means that the tooltip will not show when the popup menu
	is on the screen. This fixes bug (#331075).

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade, src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_checkbox,
	gpm_prefs_checkbox_lock_cb): Remove the lock checkboxes. :-)

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h: Add
	lock_use_screensaver_settings to *finally* fix bug (#331164)

	* src/gpm-manager.c (manager_policy_do): Allow over-ride with
	settings from gnome-screensaver. Default to using gnome-screensaver
	settings as it's most obvious. Sabayon can be used to tweak these
	settings per domain if required.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (setup_ac_actions): Hide the ac "Actions" box if
	there is no lib button, as it's now empty.
	(setup_battery_actions): Use the right glade name for the labels.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (manager_policy_do): Add action BLANK to trigger
	a DPMS monitor off state.
	(lid_button_pressed): Don't do DPMS state unless we have blank as
	our option.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: allow blank as an option for lid close events.
	This stops the problem of having "No action", "Also lock screen" in
	the GUI.

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Change the default action of
	action_ac_button_lid to blank.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (manager_policy_do): Add a do_lock argument to this
	function so we can now specificy the lock policy according to the
	event that caused the policy to be performed. Do the locking here
	rather than gpm_manager_suspend and gpm_manager_hibernate.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (idle_changed_cb): BUGFIX: Do the idle action
	-not- the critical action. Not sure how nobody has triggered this yet.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (suspend_button_pressed, lid_button_pressed):
	Query and use the new lock gconf arguments.
	We probably need to add more arguments for stuff like DBUS calls
	and tray clicks, but I don't think these have to be in the UI.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h: Add
	lock_ac_lid, lock_battery_lid, lock_button_suspend, and
	lock_sleep_idle.

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Enable the new lock checkboxes.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_checkbox_lock_cb,
	gpm_prefs_setup_checkbox): Add infrastructure so checkboxes can be tied
	to gconf keys.
	(setup_power_buttons, setup_sleep_type, setup_ac_actions,
	setup_battery_actions): Add the checkboxes into these handlers.
	NOTE, these keys get set correctly, but are not handled by the manager
	yet.

2006-02-18  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_condition): Use details if
	the button type is the empty string. Makes g-p-m do the right
	thing if I'm pressing the Sleep button on my keyboard (thanks to
	the hal patch from Matthew Garrett).

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Make action_button_lid different
	policy values for AC and battery. Default to suspend for on battery
	and nothing for on AC.

	* src/gpm-prefs.h,
	src/gpm-prefs.c (setup_battery_actions, setup_ac_actions): Set the new
	policy keys individually.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_action_combo): Add the default
	action of nothing if gconf is missing. Stops a blank combobox, and
	makes it easier for us to debug without installing new schema each
	time.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (lid_button_pressed): do the new action when lid
	is closed and on AC power. Fixes (#331448)

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Minor combobox id renames.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_action_combo): Pass this a widget.
	(setup_page_one, setup_page_two, setup_page_three): replace with
	setup_battery_sliders, setup_ac_sliders, setup_suspend_button,
	setup_sleep_type, setup_ac_actions, setup_battery_actions, and
	setup_icon_policy so that each function is specific to function, not
	location in the glade file.
	Also connect up the new widgets, so that it works like before. The new
	stuff I'm working on now.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Redesign interface. This is going to break
	g-p-p for a little while, so please bear with me.
	Also change duplicate accesskeys (#331538) and remove pointless icons
	in general tab (#331530).
	Add lots of lock checkboxes to solve (#331164) but these are disabled
	for now. We can argue about the defaults later, but I think this is
	an emotional argument with lots of different use-cases, that cannot
	be solved with just minimising the UI and making assumptions.

2006-02-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_status_changed_primary): Check the on_ac
	property before we do the action. This should ensure we don't warn, or
	do actions when removing the power lead at a short time to charge, on
	machines that lag updating the battery device. Fixes #331401.

2006-02-16  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Add --enable-actions-menu=foo so we can disable the
	menu at compile time. Fixes bug #331446

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Only add actions to the tray
	icon if ACTIONS_MENU_ENABLED is enabled.

2006-02-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.13.91

2006-02-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	==== Version 2.13.90 ====

2006-02-14  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Couple of string fixes noticed by Clytie Siddall.
	Fixes #331120.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (gpm_hash_new_devices_cache,
	gpm_hash_free_devices_cache): Add these so we can simplify our memory
	management. We need to be more careful that what we were, as hal could
	be restarted many times and we could loose lots of memory.

	(hal_monitor_stop): Inline into _finalize, as not called elsewhere.

	* src/gpm-hal.c (gpm_hal_enable_power_save): valgrind (quite rightly)
	warns of use before set. Just initialise ret to zero.

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_device_cache_entry_free) remove, as broken.

	(gpm_hash_new_kind_cache, gpm_hash_free_kind_cache,
	gpm_hash_new_device_cache, gpm_hash_free_device_cache): Add these so
	we can simplify our memory management, and not forget to free.

	(gpm_power_init): Listen for the hal-disconnected signal so we can
	clear the caches, else the devices think they are initialised.

	Fixes bug #327234.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id): Use the fully charged, not charging
	icon like we used to do.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c: Remove gpm_dbus_init_nlost, signalhandler_noc and
	all the accompanying n-o-c and name-lost stuff as it's not being used,
	and does not belong here. And it was rubbish code.
	This is all to begin to fix #327234, so we can restart hald without
	killing g-p-m.

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c: Rename proxy to proxy_hal. Add a second proxy
	called proxy_dbus that will let us get n-o-c signals.

	(gpm_hal_monitor_class_init): Add hal-connected and hal-disconnected
	signal types and descriptions.

	(hal_disconnect_signals): Free the proxy also here, as it's useless.

	(hal_connect_signals): Create the proxy, and reconnect the signals to
	the new proxy.

	(coldplug_all, un_coldplug_all): Begin to do the reconnection
	infrastructure so that devices get the signals from the new proxy.
	THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS. Restarting hald will appear to work then
	segfault g-p-m.

	(hal_name_owner_changed): Add new callback for name-owner-changed
	signals from the new proxy_dbus objects.

	(hal_monitor_stop): call un_coldplug (), as currently we are just
	loosing memory. un_coldplug is TOFIX.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-manager.h: Remove GPM_SYSTEM_BUS as we are
	always going to use the session bus.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (tray_icon_update): This function is not now
	responsible for creating and destroying the icon, it is done
	unconditionally at init, and then just hidden and shown as required.
	Rationale: we are showing notifications for lots of power stuff, and
	these break when you choose any other state than "Always Show".
	It also fixes the bug (#331002) as we are not relying on a complex
	chain of events to do the notifications. Most of this stuff is async,
	so it needs to be kept simple.

	(battery_status_changed_primary, battery_status_changed_ups,
	battery_status_changed_misc): Allow notifications without an icon
	showing in the tray.

	(gpm_manager_init): Set up the icon callbacks here, rather than in
	gpm_manager_setup_tray_icon() as this makes it *way* simpler.

	src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Add the is_visible flag so we can have quick
	safe access to the visible property. Bit of a bodge.
	Also convert a metric tonne of spaces to tabs in this file.
	Add the function gpm_tray_icon_show() so we can set the visiblity of
	the icon easily.

	(libnotify_event)'s: Allow notifications to be sent without the icon
	image, where we just use the system default if there is no widget
	present. This is what other program using libnotify do.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-common.h: Add location of FAQ page as GPM_FAQ_URL.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_suspend, gpm_manager_hibernate):
	Inform the user if the HAL command failed, and point them in the
	direction of the online FAQ page. Fixes bug #330889.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Don't do tray_icon_update here
	anymore as we havn't got the device list in order yet. This fixes the
	bug where the ac_adapter icon was being shown for a split second,
	and then changing to the required icon.

	* src/gpm-power.c (add_battery): Add in another debug statement.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_sleep_slider,
	gpm_prefs_setup_brightness_slider, setup_page_three): Only connect up
	the value-changed signal once the initial value has been set.
	This prevents the gconf keys from getting written to (if only for a
	split second), so that the icon no longer flickers when somebody
	clicks preferences or loads it from the Desktop menu.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c, src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-power.c,
	src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Add gpm_debug statements before the signal emit
	so we can trace, and see what's going on internally.

	* src/gpm-main.c (main): Do the gpm_debug_init earlier in the sequence
	else we loose the new signal messages on initialization.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.h, src/gpm-power.c (gpm_power_class_init): Add
	battery removed proxy signal so we can use it in manager.

	(add_battery): Do not query hal again, use the cached values for
	the capacity check. Also, only do this check if the battery is marked
	as present.

	(power_get_summary_for_battery_kind): Remove the complicated check
	for UPS's, as it's fragile and seems to break.
	Unconditionally display the battery type as a prefix for now, we can
	argue about the tooltip logic in a new bugzilla.

	(battery_device_cache_entry_update_all): Do more careful checking,
	(e.g. don't ask a mouse device for time_remaining) so we don't spew
	so many warnings.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Add hal_battery_removed_cb so
	we can update the icon and tooltip to fix #329027.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id): Fix a typo where
	(charging || charging) should be (charging || discharging) so that we
	get the correct icon on discharging battery with UPS attached.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add an extra state GPM_WARNING_DISCHARGING so we
	can make the UPS and primary battery stuff common in the existing
	warning framework.

	(maybe_notify_on_ac_changed): Only clear the notification now, as we
	rely on the trueness of battery.is_discharging to do the warning.

	(gpm_manager_get_warning_type): Add the check for a now-discharging
	battery_status object. Man, this generic code is easy to change.

	(battery_low_get_title): Add a string for GPM_WARNING_DISCHARGING.

	(battery_status_changed_primary): Do the warning
	"The AC Power has been unplugged." here, for GPM_WARNING_DISCHARGING.
	(battery_status_changed_ups): Do the warning
	"Your system is running on backup power!" for GPM_WARNING_DISCHARGING.
	(battery_status_changed_misc): Ignore GPM_WARNING_DISCHARGING as this
	is not relevant for pda, mouse or keyboard devices.

	(gpm_manager_init): Set last primary warning to GPM_WARNING_DISCHARGING
	as we don't want to be notified on coldplug if we are on battery power.

2006-02-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_device_cache_entry_update_key): Do a
	exponentially weighted average for the rate so that high frequency
	changes are smoothed. This should mean the time_remaining does not
	change drastically between updates.

	(battery_kind_cache_update) Also limit the time_remaining to 100 hours.
	Fixes bug #328927.

2006-02-12  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id): Refactor the code, leaving the
	logic mostly the same as before. Now it's obvious what's happening
	in the selection, and also allows a UPS icon to be chosen.
	(battery_status_changed_primary): Slight rearrangement for logic
	optimisation.
	(battery_status_changed_ups): Add a check for discharging.

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_kind_cache_update): Make work with UPS's
	as they do not provide rate information, but do provide time
	information.
	(power_get_summary_for_battery_kind): Simplify the logic, and make
	"Unknown time remaining until changed" a thing of the past.
	Also show the primary battery type, if we have a UPS installed in the
	system so we know what the remaining time is refering to.
	(gpm_power_get_status_summary): If we are using a discharging UPS, then
	set our state to "Computer is running on backup power".
	Also remove the enum structure thing as it's only used once, and it's
	easier just to use the defines directly.

	This is all to begin to fix bug : #329027

2006-02-11  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-brightness.c, src/gpm-common.h, src/gpm-debug.c, src/debug.h,

	src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-screensaver.c, src/gpm-stock-icons.c,
	src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Create gpm-warning so we can also log g_warnings
	in the same way as gpm_debug. Also make a few more #defines better
	named, e.g. GPMURL -> GPM_HOMEPAGE_URL.

2006-02-11  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (battery_low_get_title, battery_status_changed_ups,
	battery_status_changed_misc): gnome-power-manager didn't get into 2.14.
	Celebrate by adding lots of new translatable strings. These can be
	altered by someone with a better grip of English if required.

	* help/C/figures/gpm-unplugged.png, help/C/figures/gpm-options.png,
	help/C/figures/gpm-advanced.png: Add these files to enhance the yelp

	* help/C/gnome-power-manager.xml: Add the three extra files as
	screenshots, and remove the known-bugs section.

2006-02-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-debug.{c|h}: Add these files to allow us to use debugging
	that is easy to read. I spend *hours* looking at these traces.
	Copied from gnome-screensaver, (C) 2005 William Jon McCann.

	* SConstruct, src/Makefile.am: Add gpm-debug.c to be built for g-p-m

	src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Switch to the superior gpm_debug functionality.

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_kind_cache_debug_print): Reformat so the
	debug information is more compact.

2006-02-10  Lukas Novotny  <lukasnov@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added cs to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-02-10  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.h: removed 'reserved' argument from
	'battery-added' signal.

2006-02-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add GpmWarning struct so we can track the warning
	states of all the devices indervidually. Also add
	BATTERY_ACTION_PERCENTAGE and BATTERY_ACTION_REMAINING_TIME so we
	do the policy action some time after the last critical warning.

	(maybe_notify_battery_status_changed) Removed, as functionality was
	muddled. We need to split this per-batterytype, as we do very different
	things for each device, e.g. warn for mouse low, but policy and
	warnings for the primary battery.

	(gpm_manager_get_warning_type, battery_low_get_title): Abstract out
	the warning type and title generation from the background logic -- so
	we can start to split up the functions per-device.

	(battery_status_changed_primary, battery_status_changed_ups,
	battery_status_changed_misc): Add these different handlers that it's
	clear that these types have different actions and logic.
	These functions are a bit bodged w.r.t message strings, as we are in
	string freeze, and I can't add lots of new strings yet.

	(power_battery_status_changed_cb): Dont do policy here, leave it to the
	indervidual handlers for the type (e.g. battery_status_changed_primary)
	to do the actions. Makes logic lots clearer.

	Begins to fix #329027

2006-02-06  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-manager.xml: Expose actions API.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_error_quark, manager_policy_do)
	(gpm_manager_shutdown, gpm_manager_hibernate)
	(gpm_manager_suspend, power_button_pressed_cb)
	(gpm_manager_tray_icon_hibernate, gpm_manager_tray_icon_suspend):
	Add GError to public actions.

	* docs/dbus-interface.txt: Added new actions API.

	Fixes #330189.

2006-02-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/*.c, src/*.h: Fix the headers so that they are all the same,
	removing the file doxygen markup, and adding authors to some files.
	Also remove trailing whitespace from *lots* of files.
	Starting to address #327743

2006-02-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (lid_button_pressed): Only do lid sleep action
	when on battery power. Fixes bug #329512

2006-02-05  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (maybe_notify_battery_power_changed):
	We need to add the check for charging for the 100% charge
	notification else we get a 100% charged notifications (plural) a few
	times when on battery power (as the flag is cleared) and we are at
	state 100%.

	This is not possible as the is_charging state changes before the
	percentage change goes 99->100. This works this way intermittently on
	my Toshiba, and never works on my iBook. This new code seems to work
	for me in all cases. Plus we don't have to faff around and invalidate
	the "show notification" flag as we are testing the change up always.

2006-01-31 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* gpm-power.{c|h}: Introduce an enum GpmPowerBatteryType to denote the
	type of battery i.s.o. a string

	Introduce a struct GpmPowerBatteryStatus that holds all the battery
	data.
	This will make future inclusion of extra data that we can process in
	GpmManager trivial

	BATTERY_POWER_CHANGED signal changed to BATTERY_STATUS_CHANGED and now
	only indicates battery_type. User can obtain battery status by calling
	gpm_power_get_battery_status.

	Change the other code to reflect these changes

	* gpm-manager.c gpm-marshal.list: Use the new data types of gpm-power

	* gpm-manager.c (power_battery_status_changed_cb)
	Critical action now can also be time based

	(maybe_notify_battery_status_changed) make sure we only notify if
	remaining_time > 0

2006-02-02 Leonid Kanter <leon@asplinux.ru>

	* * configure.in: Added ru to ALL_LINGUAS

2006-01-29 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* gpm-power.c: (power_get_summary_for_kind) fully charged is more
	important than charging

	(battery_device_cache_entry_update_all)
	(battery_device_cache_entry_update_key) If charge_rate == 0, charging
	and discharging should be FALSE

	Bug is caused by HAL freedesktop bug #5752

	Fixes #328964

2006-01-29  Raphael Higino  <raphaelh@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added pt_BR to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-01-29  Chao-Hsiung Liao  <j_h_liau@yahoo.com.tw>

	* configure.in: Add "zh_HK" "zh_TW" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2006-01-28 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* gpm-manager.c : Oops my previous checkin did not compile

2006-01-28 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* gpm-power.c: (battery_kind_cache_update) refactor.

	Move percentagecharged to gpm-manager.c. gpm-power.c should just give
	current status. gpm-manager.c should monitor this

	* gpm-marshal.list: take into account that percentagechanged is not
	anymore in the signal of power changed

	* gpm-manager.c: Add private variable done_notification_fully_charged to
	prevent fully charged being shown multiple times

	Fixes bug #328958

2006-01-28  Christopher Aillon  <caillon@redhat.com>

	* data/Makefile.am:
	* data/gnome-power-manager.spec.in:
	Fix the autostart file location to match the spec

2006-01-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* SConstruct, sconstools/*: Add the scons build framework.
	BJörn Lindqvist has provied a framework for g-p-m that lets us build
	using the new scons framework (which I've been testing for a few weeks).
	The old autotools system will remain as default, as it works.

2006-01-28 Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* gpm-manager.c: Remove doxygen comments for functions

	(maybe_notify_battery_power_changed): simplify logic to make sure that
	notifications are shown only once. Move tray_icon_update to
	power_battery_power_changed_cb

	(maybe_notify_on_ac_changed) move tray_icon_update call to
	power_on_ac_changed_cb

	(invalidate_notification_warnings) Remove this function

	Fixes bug #328759

2006-01-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Post release bump to 2.13.90

2006-01-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	==== Version 2.13.5 ====

2006-01-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add the done_warning_critical,
	done_warning_very_low, done_warning_low bools to the struct so we can
	keep knowledge of previous notifications.

	(maybe_notify_battery_power_changed): Change to NOT primary OR
	NOT discharging as the logic was wrong. Should fix bug (#328228)
	Also only do the notifications once, and don't do lots of
	notifications on startup if battery is very low. (#327963)

	(invalidate_notification_warnings): Add this function so we can
	reset the notification accounting, which we want to do if we go from
	battery -> AC -> battery.

	(power_battery_power_changed_cb): Do a libnotify warning stating the
	action 5 seconds before we do the critical action. We should always
	explain the action we are going to do.

2006-01-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add the dim_on_idle gconf key
	so we can work on this functionality after the string freeze.

2006-01-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (power_battery_power_changed_cb): Only do action
	when discharging, trying to fix bug (#328228)

2006-01-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: "policy_can_hibernate" -> "can_hibernate" Dohh.

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_setup_action_combo): Don't segfault if
	gconf value is missing, just issue warning.

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Remove the elusive "j"
	Also change the default brightnesses for AC to be 100, and battery 50.

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c:
	Define the BATTERY_*_REMAINING_TIME constants.

	(maybe_notify_battery_power_changed): Only warn on primary battery,
	and also provide two methods for working out the notifications, to try
	to keep the peace for bug (#326743). This is based on a patch from
	Jaap, to change the notifications to time-remaining values rather than
	percentage charge.

	(power_battery_power_changed_cb): Invalidate the prior warning level
	as the power state has changed.

	(gpm_manager_init): Invalidate the warning level, and set the default
	to per-time rather than per-percentage. We can change this easily if
	this doesn't work in real world conditions, or perhaps make this a
	gconf configurable.

	(power_battery_power_changed_cb): Only do critical action on primary
	battery, fixing bug (#328228). Patch originally from Jaap.

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h:
	Flattern the gconf schema so that we don't have lots of subfolders
	for very few keys.

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.h,
	gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_can_suspend, gpm_manager_can_hibernate):
	Query the can_suspend and can_hibernate keys to fix bug (#327894)

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Do a
	s/"Power Preferences"/"Power Management Preferences" to fix the
	bug (#328397)

2006-01-24  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_button_press_cb):
	Show menu for any button press.  Fixes #327959.

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Add %{_datadir}/autostart/* so that
	the rpm builds.

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/Makefile.am: Fix up Rodrigo's commit so "make distcheck" works

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c (power_get_summary_for_kind),
	src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_format_time_cb),
	src/gpm-manager.c (maybe_notify_battery_power_changed),
	src/gpm-common.{h|c},

	Convert s\get_timestring_from_minutes\gpm_get_timestring so we now take
	seconds as the argument. This fixes bug (#328289).

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* docs/www/images/*, docs/www/*: Remove as this is already in
	gnomeweb-wml CVS. Fixes bug (#328280).

2006-01-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add the FIXME constants BATTERY_LOW_PERCENTAGE
	and BATTERY_CRITICAL_PERCENTAGE so we can get 99% of the patch of
	#326743 in CVS.

2006-01-24  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Remove threshold_low,
	threshold_critical

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Remove threshold_low, threshold_critical sliders

	* src/gpm-prefs.{c|h}: Remove threshold_low, threshold_critical sliders
	and preferences

2006-01-24  Clytie Siddall <clytie@riverland.net.au>

	* configure.in	Added vi in ALL_LINGUAS line.

2006-01-23  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.desktop.in:
	* data/Makefile.am: added .desktop file for gnome-session's
	autostart mechanism.

2006-01-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Add fexceptions to the configure line as it makes
	g-p-m blow up while testing if the signals are wrong (good thing).

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (gpm_hal_monitor_class_init): Change
	gpm_marshal_VOID__STRING_STRING to gpm_marshal_VOID__STRING as we
	only send one argument.

	* src/gpm-power.c (hal_battery_added_cb): Remove the reserved parameter
	as it's not used anywhere and only confuses us. This should fix the bug
	where the g-p-m crashes and "gdb bt" intermittently gives:
	hal_monitor_start->gpm_coldplug_batteries->g_signal_emit->
	g_signal_emit_valist->g_value_array_copy->g_strdup->strlen

2006-01-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-brightness.c (gpm_brightness_init): Actually check for the
	hardware so we don't get errors on desktop systems.

2006-01-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Add a call to
	change_power_policy () so we set the correct lcd brightness on
	startup. This meant that the lcd brightness was not being set on
	the first cold boot of g-p-m.

2006-01-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-brightness.{c|h}: Add these files which abstract out the
	lcd brightness interface nicely. The new class internally deals with
	the hardware values (0..x) and externally deals with percentages
	so that the changes recently in g-g_signal_emitp-p to store percentage now work.

	* src/Makefile.am: Add gpm-brightness.{c|h} to g-p-m.

	* src/gpm-hal.{h|c}: Remove all the LCD brightness code. This was
	always a bodge putting it in this file, and now it's faster and
	cleaner in the new class.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Adapt for the new lcd brightness function names.
	Also add the code to change the brightness when we change the
	gconf key in g-p-p. This fixes (#327895).

2006-01-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* docs/release-plan.txt: Add this file, so I can follow a tick sheet
	for a formal release :-)

2006-01-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add MAINTAINERS to the tarball, advice from Behdad,
	http://mces.blogspot.com/2006/01/release-your-maintainers.html

2006-01-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c (watch_device_condition): Find the UDI from
	the proxy path, as before we were just reading random data...

2006-01-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* docs/dbus-interface.txt: Document CanSuspend and CanHibernate.

2006-01-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init): Add a call to tray_icon_update
	so that desktop systems get an icon if specified in gconf.
	Fixes problems described in #327799, Comment 16.

2006-01-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_set_image_from_stock): Comment out
	gtk_image_clear() as it requires gtk 2.8. For FC4 we can't depend on
	more then 2.6. No visual change.

2006-01-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_set_image_from_stock):
	Interpret a NULL stock id as no icon.
	(gpm_tray_icon_embedded): Set a flag when embedded in
	a socket.
	(gpm_tray_icon_class_init, gpm_tray_icon_notify): If
	not embedded don't do notifications.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (get_stock_id): Return in one place.
	(tray_icon_update, maybe_notify_on_ac_changed)
	(maybe_notify_battery_power_changed): Don't try to
	send notifications if we don't have a tray icon.  Move
	policy do out of here.
	(power_battery_power_changed_cb): Do the policy action
	here.

	Fixes #327799.

2006-01-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-power.c: (power_get_summary_for_kind) Make tooltip more
	concise. Make some comments clearer or remove them.
	* src/gpm-common.c: return "Unknown time" if minutes <=0 for
 	get_timestring_from_minutes ()

	Patch from Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>
	Fixes #327443

2006-01-20  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-prefs.h: Use enum for icon policy.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_dbus_method_bool, gpm_can_suspend)
	(gpm_can_hibernate): Check with the daemon to see if
	we are capable and allowed to do these things.
	(gpm_has_batteries, gpm_has_lcd, gpm_has_button_sleep)
	(gpm_has_button_lid): Make functions to check these
	things.
	(gpm_prefs_icon_radio_cb): Don't leak gconf client.
	(gpm_prefs_format_brightness_cb): Don't use
	device dependent lcdsteps.
	(gpm_prefs_format_percentage_cb): Don't cast to int
	to guard against overflow.
	(gpm_prefs_format_time_cb): Use one return.
	(gpm_prefs_sleep_slider_changed_cb): Don't leak client.
	(gpm_prefs_setup_sleep_slider): ditto.
	(gpm_prefs_brightness_slider_changed_cb): Don't leak
	client.  Don't try to change brightness of devices here.
	(gpm_prefs_setup_brightness_slider): Don't leak client.
	Don't use device dependent lcdsteps.
	(gpm_prefs_action_combo_changed_cb): Don't leak.
	(gpm_prefs_setup_action_combo): Don't leak.  Use
	local _can_ functions instead of checking HAL directly
	so that we can also check gconf policy.
	(gpm_prefs_battery_low_slider_changed_cb): Don't leak.
	(setup_page_one, setup_page_two, setup_page_three)
	(gpm_prefs_create): Break up the creation and setup
	of each notebook tab to make it less monolithic.

	* src/gpm-manager.xml: Add CanSuspend, CanHibernate,
	and CanShutdown.

	(gpm_manager_can_hibernate, gpm_manager_can_shutdown):
	Make these methods public and expose to the bus.

	string to an enum for internal use.
	(gpm_manager_shutdown, gpm_manager_hibernate)
	(gpm_manager_suspend, gpm_manager_setup_tray_icon):
	Use new API for _can_ functions.

	* src/Makefile.am: Don't need gpm-screensaver
	for prefs.

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Remove time estimates
	for low and critical battery since this is
	device and system dependent.

2006-01-19  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/gpm-hal-callback.[ch]: Remove hal-callback.

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c: Don't use hal-callback
	to get HAL signals.  Do it here.

	Fixes #327235

2006-01-19  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gpm_prefs_help_cb): Use gnome_help.
	Fixes #326890

2006-01-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (maybe_notify_battery_power_changed):
	Revert the 20, 10, 5, and 2 checks. Definatly needs more work.
	Apologies, brain was not in gear.

2006-01-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_kind_cache_add_device): Turn the warning
	about "Adding missing device, may bug" into a debug statement, as this
	is now well tested.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (maybe_notify_battery_power_changed):
	Only notify the user of low battery on the 20, 10, 5, and 2
	minute intervals. Probably needs more work.

2006-01-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: Make the combo bokes in options expand so that
	we don't get comboboxes of different sizes.

2006-01-18  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_kind_cache_update): Use floating
	point division to get a fraction.  Don't declare a variable
	in the middle of a block.  Use spaces around all operators.
	Use braces around blocks.
	(power_get_summary_for_kind): Use spaces around operators.
	Fix case where !is-charging && !is-discharging.
	Fixes #327471

2006-01-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (gpm_signal_handler_noc, signalhandler_noc):
	Be less vocal about changes in the bus -- we only want to know about
	g-p-m and hal, not everything else.

2006-01-17  Adam Weinberger  <adamw@gnome.org>

	* data/gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Correct two typos.
	  Fixes bug #327396.

2006-01-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (gpm_manager_init):
	Do not do tray_icon_update () in the initialization, else
	we get an ac_adapter icon for a split second (as state is unknown)
	then a battery icon.

	* src/gpm-manager.c (maybe_notify_battery_power_changed),
	* src/gpm-manager.c (maybe_notify_on_ac_changed):
	Remove the checks on manager->priv->tray_icon, as the icon does not
	have to exist before entering these functions.
	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_init): Don't initialise this
	to the ac_adapter icon, use a blank image instead.

2006-01-17  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* AUTHORS: Add myself.

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c: Add myself as an author.

	Also make all the time values in seconds.

	* src/gpm-idle, src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-prefs.c: Update, as now all
	the gconf values are in seconds. (#327007)

	* src/gpm-power.c (add_battery): Add a warning for a low capacity
	battery, to start to fix (#326740) -- yet more work required.

2006-01-14  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* data/gpm-prefs.glade: A few HIG spacing fixes.  This makes
	it look the same as g-v-m.

2006-01-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-power.c: Fix newline logic to be the same as before (so it
	doesn't truncate the last bracket in some cases).
	Also replace spaces-for-tabs in this file with actual tabs.

	* src/gpm-marshal.list, src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-power.c:
	Add a parameter "charging" and "percentagechanged" which lets us veto
	some actions when doing the initial startup. This stops the message
	"Your battery is fully charged"	when starting g-p-m with a full battery.
	Also unconditionally send a signal battery-power-changed when *any*
	battery property changes, so that the icon changes when !charging
	as this was not being done.

	* MAINTAINERS: I have a name, I am not an email address.

	* CodingStyle: Update with suggestions from (#326515)

	* src/gpm-power.c (battery_kind_cache_update): Always send a
	BATTERY_POWER_CHANGED signal when devices disappear.

	* src/gpm-power.c (gpm_power_get_battery_percentage): Return false
	when a BatteryKindCacheEntry is marked as not present, as ACPI
	batteries are not removed from HAL when they are removed.
	This fixes (#326865)

	* docs/www/*.html: Update the archive links, and make sure the header
	is bold for each section.

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_show_help_cb):
	Replace spaces-for-tabs with actual tabs.

	(gpm_manager_init, gpm_manager_finalize): Updates for gpm-power

	* src/gpm-main.c: Fix compiler warnings.

	* src/gpm-hal-monitor.c: Remove core and sysdev.  Make
	into a singleton.  Make signals a bit more generic.
	Primarily serve as a HAL proxy.

	* src/gpm-hal-callback.h: Fix prototypes.

	* src/gpm-dpms.h: Fix typo.

	* src/Makefile.am: Remove gpm-core and gpm-sysdev.
	Use found glib-genmarshal.

	* configure.in: Look for glib-genmarshal. Add
	extra warnings when building from CVS.

	Fixes #326515

2006-01-12  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in: Remove gpm-dbus-signal-handler.{c|h} to fix
	make diskcheck.

	* src/gpm-hal.c (gpm_hal_can_suspend), (gpm_hal_can_hibernate):
	Fix logic so that is key is missing we do not do the action.

	* src/gpm-sysdev.c (hal_to_device_type): Moved here from gpm-common.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Add missing includes.

	* src/gpm-manager.c: Add include for gnome-client.h and sysdev.
	(_gpm_manager_can_suspend, _gpm_manager_can_hibernate)
	(_gpm_manager_can_shutdown): Add functions to use instead of
	calling HAL directly.
	(get_stock_id): Use our own on_ac property instead of calling HAL.
	(get_full_tooltip): Ditto.
	(gpm_manager_shutdown, gpm_manager_hibernate)

	src/gpm-hal.c, src/gpm-hal-callback.c, src/gpm-idle.c,
	src/gpm-manager.c, src/gpm-screensaver.c, src/gpm-prefs.c:
	Remove gpm-dbus-common from all the files. This file was originally
	used when the DBUS API was churning so all the changes could be done
	in one place. Now the glib DBUS api is stable, hardcode these simple
	functions in the respective places.

2006-01-10  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-manager.c (hal_power_button_cb, hal_lid_button_cb):

	* src/gpm-dpms-x11.c (gpm_dpms_error_quark): Add errors.
	(x11_sync_server_dpms_settings): Set errors.
	Also allow zero timeouts as this is how we'll disable
	DPMS now that we enable it by default.
	(x11_get_mode, x11_set_mode): Use a more DBUSy
	design.
	(sync_settings): Use zero for timeouts instead of
	our configured ones when DPMS isn't active.

	* src/gpm-tray-icon.c (gpm_tray_icon_show_help_cb): Now use yelp
	help-pages rather than just displaying the webpage -- note these
	need serious love.

	* src/gpm-stock-icons.c (gpm_stock_icons_init): Replace
	GTK_ICON_SIZE_LARGE_TOOLBAR with GTK_ICON_SIZE_MENU as we want the
	smaller icons used in the tray.

	* man/gnome-power-info.sgml: remove as unused.

	NEWS, configure.in: Update to 0.3.4, as I think enough work has been
	done to constitute a release bump. :-)

2006-01-09  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* src/gpm-manager.xml: Mark return string as constant.

	* src/gpm-manager.[ch] (gpm_manager_set_on_ac)

	(main): Rename function in case we want to turn it into
	a class later.

2005-01-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* data/: src/gnome-power-preferences.glade,
	gnome-power-manager.conf, gnome-power-manager.schemas.in,
	gnome-power-manager.service.in, gnome-power-manager.spec.in,
	gnome-power-preferences.desktop.in: Move these files to this new

	Add /notify/fully_charged to fix bug:
	#325876

	* src/Makefile.am: Build the generated files a slightly easier way, as
	suggested by BJörn Lindqvist.
	Also comment out the gnome-power-console stuff until the DBUS bug is
	fixed -- as now it's pretty useless.

	* configure.in: Fix the ALL_LINGUAS to be all on one line, else
	autogen.sh fails.

	*configure.in, Makefile.am: Don't build help/ yet as
	"make distcheck" fails (which means no rpm's)

2006-01-03  Slobodan D. Sredojevic  <ssl@uns.ns.ac.yu>

	* configure.in: Added 'sr' and 'sr@Latn' to ALL_LINGUAS

2006-01-03  Anders Pedersen <anders@zredna.dk>

	* src/gpm-notification.c : fixed typo where global variable
	where used instead of passed parametre

2005-12-30  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c : removed require pw option. We just rely on
	gnome-screensaver for this now

	* src/gpm-prefs.glade : removed require pw option.

2005-12-30  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c : refactored slider format callbacks

	* configure.in, Makefile.am, docs/Makefile.am: Fix build to work.

2005-12-29  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Add "Requires: dbus-x11" to fix
	rh:176656

	* src/gpm-sysdev.{c|h}, src/gpm-console.c, src/gpm-core.c,
	src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-notification.c:
	Replace all the SysDev functions with gpm_sysdev_ to closer match
	GNOME CodingStyle.

	* src/gpm-hal.c (gpm_hal_is_on_ac): Fix for the case of a desktop,
	where there is no ac_adapter.

	* src/gpm-screensaver (gpm_screensaver_get_idle): Do a
	s/getIdleTime/getActiveTime to update to the new API.

2005-12-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}:
	Much modified patch from Jaap to use the gnome-screensaver
	screensave enable gconf key, rather than our own complete replacement.

2005-12-26  Jaap Haitsma  <jaap@haitsma.org>

	* src/gpm_marshal.list: rename to gpm-marshal.list

	* src/Makefile.am : change gpm_marshal.{c|h} to gpm-marshal.{c|h}

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.c: change gpm_marshal.h to gpm-marshal.h

	* src/gpm-hal-callback.c: change gpm_marshal.h to gpm-marshal.h

2005-12-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Patch from Jaap: Suspend is still using battery so
	for a critical level of the battery suspend is not viable option.

2005-12-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Don't hardcode acpi_BAT1, but work out the name
	using the capability.

	Another mega patch from Jaap. I've merged the obvious bit for now,
	and when I've reviewed the rest I'll commit that too.

	* Renamed some function like gpm_screensaver_set_dpms to
	gpm_screensaver_enable_dpms. This way it's immediately clear what the
	argurment TRUE or FALSE does.

	* Some other renames which should make the code clearer.

	* Fixes a couple of minor bugs

	* Moved some definition from *.h to *.c. It's good practice to export
	as little as possible.

2005-12-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/*: Rename the local dbus_* wrappers gpm_dbus_* to make sure
	it's obvious that they are local functions and not the direct API.

	* gnome-power-manager.conf: Add root to the allowed users. Required
	for replacement without a GUI running.

	* src/gpm-dbus-signal-handler.{c|h}: Add these files to abstract the
	DBUS NameOwnerChanged and NameLost glib functionality.

	* src/glibhal-callback.{c|h}: Remove the NameOwnerChanged bodged
	support from these files. It never belonged here..

	* src/Makefile.am, src/gpm-console.c, src/gpm-dbus-common.c,
	src/gpm-main.c: Use gpm-dbus-signal-handler and start to implement
	NameLost functionality for a shared bus. Also pass more connections
	by reference, rather than assuming then are system or session.

	* src/gpm-hal.c: Move gpm_hal_is_running here, and delete the copy in
	glibhal-main.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.{c|h}, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-dbus-server.c:
	Make USECACHE an ifdef to try and profile.
	Also add GPM_SYSTEM_BUS so we can put g-p-m on the system bus if
	we want, so it can be shared between users. This cannot be turned on
	until https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4637 is fixed.

	* src/gpm-hal.c: Fix valgrinds "Conditional jump or move depends on
	uninitialised value(s)" by initialising the return value to 0.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.h, src/glibhal.c, src/glibhal-callback.c,
	src/gpm-hal.c, src/gpm-main.c: Define the HAL_DBUS_* constants and
	use them in preference to hardcoding each name.

	* src/glibhal-main.{c|h}: Merge the remainder of these functions into
	gpm-hal.{c|h} and prefix the functions with gpm_ for clarity.

	* src/glibhal-callback.{c|h}: Move these functions into
	gpm-hal-callback.{c|h} and prefix the functions with gpm_ for clarity.

2005-12-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: If no valid options are available then disable
	the "Actions" frame as it will be empty.

	* src/gpm-prefs.h, src/gpm-main.c, gnome-power-manager.schemas.in:
	Implement /apps/gnome-power-manager/notify/ac_adapter so we can
	disable this message if we want to. Fixes the bug:
	rh:176433

	* src/gpm-libnotify.{c|h}, src/gpm-notification.c, src/gpm-main.c:
	Rename the local libnotify_* wrappers gpm_libnotify_* to make sure
	it's obvious that they are local functions and not the direct API.

2005-12-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Only hide the battery stuff in the advanced
	tab, and fix to actually hide the correct label in Options.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Don't g_free eggtrayicon->popup_menu
	or eggtrayicon->tray_icon_tooltip else we segfault on rawhide.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Assume we are on AC power (desktop) if we have
	no batteries or ac_adapters detected. Fixes a problem with g-p-m
	running on a VMWware host thinking we are on batteries.

	* src/gpm-libnotify.c: Use widget->allocation to get size to avoid
	having to ref the pixbuf. Also make lots of libnotify 0.3.x
	fixes. I think notify-daemon has a positioning bug...

	* src/gpm-idle.c: Only print debug messages once.

2005-12-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Hide, process, then show the top window so that
	the dialogue resizes itself without redrawing.
	Fixes #323562

	* gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Apply a patch from Matthias Saou to
	fix rh:172963

2005-12-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/eggtrayicon.c, src/gpm-prefs.c: Update so that if gnome-panel
	disappears we just re-instantiate the icon without crashing.
	Fixes #324446

	* src/gpm-sysdec.{c|h}, gpm-notification.c: Add the sd->isPresent
	flag so we can detect when an sd has no present sds members.
	Fixes #323563

2005-12-19  Nikos Charonitakis  <nikosx@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added 'el' to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-12-19  Ankit Patel  <ankit644@yahoo.com>

        * configure.in: Added 'gu' to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-12-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/glibhal-extras.{c|h}: Rename to gpm-hal.{c|h} and prefix the
	functions with "gpm_". Affects most of the other souce files!

	* src/gpm-info.{c|h|glade}: Removed until we have a point.

	* src/gpm-gtk-utils.{c|h}: Removed as unused.

	* src/compiler.h: Removed as now unused.

	* configure.in: Make warnings stop build. Fix said warnings.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Don't use a pointer like a global variable, else
	it bites back. Use INT_TO_POINTER to wrap it up nicely.

	* src/gpm-hal.c, src/gpm-prefs.c: Add gpm_hal_is_on_ac() so we can get
	rid of the gpm dbus dependance on gpp.

	* configure.in, src/gpm-libnotify.c: Automatically compile the correct
	code for the new libnotify. Thanks again to Jaap.

2005-12-17  Josep Puigdemont i Casamajó  <josep.puigdemont@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added 'ca' to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-12-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.3.3, and depend on HAL CVS (0.5.6) as we need
	the new power_management keys and the Shutdown() method not present in
	0.5.5.1.

	* src/glibhal-extras.{c|h}, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-prefs.h:
	Create the function hal_shutdown () that lets us simplify the
	shutdown stuff, and take the magic string out of gconf.

	MASSIVE Patch from Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org> with tweaks from me:

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}: Move get_widget_position to gpm-libnotify.c
	Remove the enumerated types, and conversion functions, and remove
	the function run_gconf_script()

	* src/compiler.h: Remove as unused.

	* src/gpm-console: Refactor some code, and remove compiler definition.

	* src/gpm-core.c: Refactor some code, remove globals, fix up some
	wrong return values.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.c: Include <string.h>

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Remove the enumerated types, and conversion
	functions. Other minor warnings fixed.

	* src/gpm-main.{c|h}: Added the constants for gconf.
	Make the policy change more centered. Remove helper functions.

	* src/gpm-networkmanager.c: Removed some unused variables.

	* src/gpm-prefs.glade: Step size update

	* src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}: Removed some unused variables.
	Added the constants for gconf.

	* src/gpm-sysdev.{h|c}: Mark the debug functions as such, and use the
	debug functions.

2005-12-11  Theppitak Karoonboonyanan  <thep@linux.thai.net>

	* configure.in: Added 'th' (Thai) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-12-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.c: Cache the dbus connection in two private
	pointers so we don't have to keep doing dbus_g_bus_get everytime we
	want the bus address.

2005-12-07  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-prefs.c:
	Remove ACTION_WARNING as nothing uses it. Also make the critical
	warning happen at the critical threshold, and any action performed when
	it gets lower than that. This will stop the PC randomly shutting down
	without giving a critical warning a few minutes before.

	* src/gpm-main.c (gnome_shutdown): Create this function so we can
	save the state interactivly for the case of a power button, or save
	the state non-interactivly for the case of the power-critically-low
	case. Inspired by a patch from Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, gnome-power-manager.schema.in:
	Remove the options for the power button, as we now display the menu
	(which remembers our state, so we don't need a configurable).
	Patch from Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>, many thanks.

2005-12-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-common.h, src/gpm-main.c, gnome-power-manager.schemas.in:
	Remove the reboot command as it's not used, and probably shouldn't be
	part of g-p-m anyway. Taken from a larger patch from
	Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>.

2005-12-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/glibhal-extras.c: Now upstream HAL is using the new
	power_management.* keys, we should not be checking .is_enabled as this
	has been removed in CVS.

	* src/gpm-common.c (get_timestring_from_minutes): Use ngettext to get
	plural form. Based on a patch from Gabor Kelemen, many thanks.
	Fixes bug #322773

	* src/gpm-main.c: Add in the virtual buttons Hibernate, Suspend and
	Lock.

	* src/gpm-screenaver.c: Do not expect a DBUS answer when we lock or
	poke as we have to wait for the dbus connection to time out.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Replace use of get_time_string with the data itself.
	Fixes bug: #323135

	* src/gpm-common.c (get_time_string): Remove this function as it is
	no longer in use.

2005-12-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.3.2

	* src/glibhal-extras.{h|c}: Move hal_pm_check() here, and create the
	new methods hal_pm_can_suspend() and hal_pm_can_hibernate().
	Also add hal_set_brightness_up() and hal_set_brightness_down () so
	we can start to play around with new HAL stuff.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Warn if we attempt to hibernate or suspend when HAL
	says we shouldn't.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Add support for the HAL "virtual button" device.
	NB. This is not yet in HAL CVS, and support is patched in only if you
	use the RPM's in my utopia-experimental repo. The interface WILL change
	before it is accepted upstream.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Don't add the menu items if we can't do the
	actions. NOTE: just because HAL (i.e. the kernel) says it has
	hibernation or suspend support compiled in, doesn't automatically
	mean that it will *work*.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Don't show the options if we can't do the action.
	Also make the whitespace a bit more sane in this file.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Don't try to free a constant if schema missing.
	Fixes bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=174196

2005-11-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.c (gpn_icon_update): Don't try to free a
	constant, i.e. use g_strdup so we unconditionally free the string.
	This bug only appears when the gconf schema isn't being applied,
	which is probably a packaging bug.

2005-11-28  Ignacio Casal Quinteiro  <nacho.resa@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Added 'gl' to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-11-27  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (perform_power_policy): Create this new function
	so we can put all the common code together. This also lets us sets
	all the settings in one place, so we can now do every power saving
	action simply when we are booted from battery. This fixes the bug where
	the brightness wasn't being set on boot.

	* src/gpm-main.c (perform_sleep_methods): Put all the common code in
	one place so we can set the password resume policy in one place.

	* gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Add general/require_password to
	signify if we require a password when resuming from suspend.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-prefs.glade:
	Add the required widgets to control "general/require_password"

	* configure.in: Bump HAL dep to 0.5.4 as using 0.5.3 doesn't work
	correctly with Ubuntu breezy HAL, which is causing lots of bug reports.

	* gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Remove the prefix line as it's not
	correct, and the rpm builds fine without it.

	* src/gpm-notification.h, src/gpm-notification.c:
	Fix the problem where the About window's content is not localizable.
	Apply a patch from Gabor Kelemen that makes it localizable.
	Fixes #322547

2005-11-26  Marcel Telka  <marcel@telka.sk>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added sk.

2005-11-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gnome-power-manager.schemas.in:
	Default to suspend on lid close on advice of Havoc Pennington, to
	address bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=174160
	Also make /apps/gnome-power-manager/policy/sleep_type to type suspend
	as nothing is no longer a valid option.

	* configure.in:
	Bump to 0.3.1

	* src/gpm-notification.c:
	Disable 'Power Info' from the menu until we show something interesting.

	* gnome-power-preferences.desktop.in:
	Rename "Power Preferences" to "Power Management" to better fit in with
	the other menu items.

2005-11-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-prefs.glade:
	Merge a patch by Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>:
	- Changed vertical spacing between some items in dialog from 4 to 6
	pixels (HIG says it should be 6)
	- All capplets have the dialog hint set for the window so they don't
	have a minimize button.
	- Removed the setting from the icon from the glade file to the C file.

2005-11-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-prefs.glade:
	Merge a patch by Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>:
	Split the General section in the options Tab to two sections:
	General and Actions. Tweaked by me.
	Furthermore it changes accesskeys of some labels to more sensible keys.
	Also remove the gnome-screensaver button now g-p-m is less tied into
	g-s with the DPMS settings.

	* src/gpm-core.{c|h}:
	Add the core, abstracted interfaces so we can use them with a console
	program. Taken from gpm-main.c.

	* src/gpm-console.c:
	Add the beginning of a console g-p-m for GDM.

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}:
	Re-organise with the console muddle.

	* src/gpm-idle.c, src/gpm-info.c, src/gpm-main.c,
	src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}:
	s/gscreensaver_/gpm_screensaver/g for consistancy.
	Also add gpm_screensaver_poke so we can interrupt the screensaver
	instead of waiting for a keypress.

2005-11-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-networkmanager.{c|h}:
	Add methods to call NetworkManager to tell it to sleep or wake during
	the suspend/resume calls. This isn't connected into the build yet
	as we have to solve 3 sec timeout problem when NM isn't running.

	* src/glibhal-extras.c:
	If the manufacturer is IBM, then assume we are a ThinkPad,
	and don't do the new-fangled dimming routine. The ThinkPad dims
	gently itself. This fixes the bug:
	rh:173382

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.{c|h}:
	Add dbus_is_active_service so we can print and search the services
	on the system bus.

	* src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}, src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-idle.c:
	First, do s\gscreensaver_\gpm_screensaver_\g to be consistant.
	Also add gpm_screensaver_poke() to allow us to "poke" g-s so we can
	displays the unlock dialogue, so the user doesn't have to move the
	mouse or press any key.

2005-11-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-info.c, src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-prefs.glade,
	src/icons/Makefile.am:
	Merge a patch by Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>:
	- "Never" on the right of the sleep sliders
	- Sleep sliders range from 1 to 60 minutes with steps of 1 minute
	- In Makefiles GPM_DATA had a trailing slash. This is not common.
	- Some code refactoring: There was now one callback handling all the
	different sliders. Since there are three types of sliders:
	1. Setting sleep time
	2. Setting disply brightness
	3. The low and critical threshold
	That callback became quite messy. So instead of 1 difficult to
	understand I made 3 of them which should be quite easy to understand.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: display the charged icon whenever we are
	not discharging and not charging as opposed to when at 100% as some
	batteries will never get to the maximum value.
	Should fix #321034

2005-11-14  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-prefs.c:
	Merge a patch by Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org>:
	- Make gpm use the standard gnome way to do command line parsing
	(using popt).
	- Furthermore after a gnome_program_init there is no need to do a
	gtk_init, g_type_init etc. because gnome_program_init already does this.
	- Also, gpm-prefs did not have the standard calls to bindtextdomain etc.

2005-11-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h}: Add gscreensaver_set_dpms() to solve the
	case where the laptop backlight isn't being turned off when the
	lid goes down. For the time being, we'll use the hack that is xset,
	but when (if?) gnome-screensaver supports a DBUS method we'll switch
	to that. Should solve #321313

	* src/gpm-main.c: Use gscreensaver_set_dpms on the lid events.

	* po/nl.po: Updated, thanks Theetjuh.

	* src/Makefile.am: Add the extra director defines.

2005-11-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-sysdev.c: Create a helper function sysDevGetIndex so we don't
	have to bounds check every request, and cast in every call.

	* src/icons/gnome-power-ac-charged.png,	src/gpm-notification.c,
	src/gpm-stock-icons.{c|h}:
	Remove the charging symbol when the battery is at 100% and not charging.

	* docs/www/packages.html: Add info about running HAL as root in breezy.

2005-11-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.h: Give credit to the translators.

	* src/gpm-main.c, gpm-sysdev.c: Rearrange the icon processing so it's
	done *after* the sysdev update.

2005-11-10  Alexander Shopov  <ash@contact.bg>

	* configure.in: Added "bg" (Bulgarian) to ALL_LINGUAS

2005-11-10  Fabio Marzocca  <thesaltydog@gmail.com>

	* po/ChangeLog:
	* po/it.po:

	Updated italian translation

2005-11-10  Ilkka Tuohela  <hile@iki.fi>

	* configure.in: Added Finnish (fi) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-11-10  Satoru SATOH <ss@gnome.gr.jp>

	* configure.in: Added Japanese (ja) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-11-10  Žygimantas Beručka  <zygis@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added Lithuanian to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-11-09  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* po/: Update all the po files with the latest translations.

	* src/gpm-sysdev.c (sysDevUpdate): The ac_adapter charging thing was
	causing more trouble than it's worth...

2005-11-08  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-libnotify.{c|h}:
	Clear the libnotify box for where we add back the ac_adapter before
	the "AC Power unplugged" message times out.

	* src/gpm-notification.c, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-prefs.glade,
	gpm-common.{c|h}, gpm-prefs.c:
	Make the notification icons into radio boxes and make the options sane.

2005-11-07  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-sysdev.c: Shortcut for the single battery case so we don't
	average over 1 each time. Might save a few CPU cycles.
	Also try to start to fix:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=169158
	by multiplying the remainingTime by the number of devices present
	if one battery is discharging and others not. This assumes they have
	the same capacity, and needs to be fixed properly.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Don't use sysDevUpdateAll when we have the UDI and
	can work out the system device to do a specific sysDevUpdate.
	This should make g-p-m less processor hungry.

2005-11-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.c, src/gpm-sysdev.c:
	Do not segfault when battery bay is empty, and only add present
	batteries to the calculations.
	Fixes #320658

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Check for discharging and charging instead
	of checking for 100%.
	Should fix #320836

	* src/gpm-sysdev.{c|h}, src/gpm-main.c: Add sd link to parent so we
	can find our device type. Update the correct battery type, not just
	BATT_PRIMARY on HAL event.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Do not leak eggtrayicon by just hiding it,
	but properly unrealize it. This fixes the bug where the icon "moved"
	across the notification area when it was repeatedly shown/hidden.

	* src/gpm-sysdev.{c|h}, gpm-main.c (hal_device_property_modified):
	Check that the battery is at 100%, AND of type "primary" before
	notifying the user that their battery is charged :-)

2005-11-05  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Change libwnck dep to 2.10.0. Not sure what happened
	with that... Update version 0.2.10 as I have made MASSIVE changes
	to the internals of g-p-m.

	* src/gpm-sysdev.{c|h}: New files to abstract away the multiple device
	problem. We are not using the shitty slotData and VirtualType system
	anymore as it is not flexible and it not understandable.
	Imagine ripping out the Ford Fiesta engine and replacing it with a
	Ferrarri engine and you get the idea of the changes...
	This will let us support multi-batteries *much* better.

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}: Rip out the old device structures and functions.
	This makes hughsie happy.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Now we show the icons if low, or if we want
	to overrride for the primary battery. Anything else is crack.

	* src/gpm-libnotify.c: Now make all notifications replace the former,
	to stop notifications from piling up the screen. Also point to the
	bottom middle part of the icon, not the top left most point.

	* src/gpm-dbus-server.c, gpm-main.c: Replace use of statedata
	with onAcPower.

	* src/gpm-prefs.glade, gnome-power-manager.schemas.in, src/gpm-prefs.c:
	Remove the configurable option for ac_adapter removal
	(warning hardcoded). Also remove the Always Display textbox.

2005-11-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.9.2 as we have lots of new stuff to test.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Replace create_icon_pixbuf () with
	get_stock_id_for_slot_data so we can use the new stock icons.

	* src/gpm-stock-icons.{c|h}: Add the extra icons.

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}: Remove gpm_set_icon_with_theme () and
	gpm_icon_theme_fallback () as Jaap has provided a proper framework for
	us to use.

	* src/icons/*.png: Refactor icons to 24x24 to keep the HIG people happy
	and also so we can use the stock icons functionality.

	* src/icons/Makefile.am: Add new files gnome-power-mouse.png and
	gnome-power-keyboard.png as we will use these files soon for low
	device warning.

2005-10-31  Christopher Aillon  <caillon@redhat.com>

	* src/gpm-common.c:
	* src/gpm-common.h:
	Signature of get_time_string () and get_timestring_from_minutes ()
	now return gchar* instead of GString*
	Also, handle the case when we have multiple hours but only 1 minute
	and use commas to separate the units.

	* src/gpm-main.c:
	* src/gpm-notification.c:
	* src/gpm-prefs.c:
	Use gchar* instead of GString* for calls to get_time_string ()
	and get_timestring_from_minutes ()

2005-10-31  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Spring clean this file so it's readable.

	* CodingStyle: Update.

	* gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Use the dep values from autoconf.

	* gnome-power-manager.sgml,
	* gnome-power-preferences.sgml,
	* gnome-power-info.sgml: Move to docs/man/

2005-10-31  Dennis Cranston  <dennis_cranston@yahoo.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.glade:  GNOME HIG fixes (spacing, mnemonics,
	and capitalization)

2005-10-31  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (main): Disable GNOME_RESTART_IMMEDIATELY as a couple
	of users are getting constant crashes that they can't kill.

2005-10-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

2005-10-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Configure.in: Default to off for doxygen documentation as most users
	do not need these (and this saves us time for each compile).
	Also bump to 0.2.9, as we are introducing new functionality.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Fix up the menu to be more in line with
	GNOME HIG. Thanks to Jaap Haitsma <jaap@haitsma.org> for the patch.

	* src/gpm-main.c: remove the last bits of the "registered" gslist.
	Also invalidate the remaining time on battery.rechargeable.is_charging
	as we need to wait for the next HAL update. This is a HAL bug I think.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Use gtk_image_set_from_icon_name rather than
	our inbuilt functions.

	* src/gpm-stock-icons.{c|h}: This is the start for generic stock
	icons functionality. At the moment it just adds the ac_adapter icon,
	but it's expected to work for all the other icons too.
	Initial patch by Jaap Haitsma.

	* src/icons/: Move gnome-dev-acadapter.png and gnome-power.png here.

	* src/pixmaps/: Remove this directory as it is now not required.

2005-10-29  Christopher Aillon  <caillon@redhat.com>

	* src/gpm-libnotify.c:
	* src/gpm-libnotify.h:
	(libnotify_event) Add a new argument for setting the
	primary text of a notify event, and use it for calls to
	libnotify and its GtkMessageDialog fallback.

	* src/gpm-main.c:
	* src/gpm-prefs.c:
	Send descriptive primary text with libnotify_event () calls.

2005-10-29  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gpm-notification.c (get_object_tooltip): Do not display
	"Unknown remaining" for missing remaining time.
	Fixes #320135

	* src/icons/gnome-power-keyboard.png,
	src/icons/gnome-power-mouse.png: New icons from Diana Fong to convey
	a low power USB mouse and keyboard. Many thanks!

	automatically; don't explicitly clean Makefile and Makefile.in and
	other automatically handled files

2005-10-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* docs/www/dbus_interface.php, src/gpm-dbus-server.{c|h},

	* configure.in: Change hal dep from 0.5.4 to 0.5.3 so we can build on
	ubuntu breezy. 0.5.3 will work with g-p-m, but there are lots of bugs
	in 0.5.3 fixed in later releases.
	Also bump to 0.2.8.1, and release.

	* src/gpm-info.glade : Don't hide this window, make it "normal" like
	the others.

	* src/gpm-main.c (main) : Register the name of the application rather
	than something random (to the session-manager).
	Patch from Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org>

	than DISTCLEAN so we can build on ubuntu.

2005-10-22  Christopher Aillon  <caillon@redhat.com>

	* src/gpm-libnotify.c:
	Use GtkMessageDialog instead of GnomeMessageBox since the former
	supports PangoMarkup and the latter is deprecated.

2005-10-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, gpm-common.c: Fix a NULL pointer dereference where
	the remaining_time isn't known, and the battery is low.
	Also don't crash when we do not have gnome-dev-memory in our theme.
	Reported by Andrey Tuev, thanks!

2005-10-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/*.c: Lots of doxygen additions and cleanups.

2005-10-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	NameOwnerChanges callback infrastructure, so we can now detect when
	HAL disappears from the system bus.

2005-10-12  Robert Love  <rml@novell.com>

	* src/gpm-info.c: Fix various compiler warnings.

2005-10-10  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	src/gpm-prefs.glade, src/gpm-notification.c: Add the new
	display_icon_others functionality so we can support desktops with
	wireless mice. This is turned off by default.

2005-10-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (read_battery_data): Try to get an debug report if
	we are missing battery.remaining_time or
	battery.charge_level.percentage.
	Also add a newline after the version string -- patch thanks to

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Make lots smaller :-) This is in prep for another
	program, g-p-i.

	* src/gpm-info.c: The start of another program, GNOME Power Info

	* src/Makefile.am: Add these extra files, and add gnome-power-info
	to the built files.

	* src/dbus-common.{c|h}: Rename to gpm-dbus-common.{c|h}

2005-10-04  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (hal_device_property_modified): display a notification

2005-10-04  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Update docs and remove sounds.

	* src/sounds: Remove.

	* src/icons, src/gpm-notification.c: Rename icons to better suit gpm.

	* src/preferences.glade: Remove

	* src/gpm-prefs.glade, src/gpm-info.glade: Add these new files.
	I've split the information stuff into it's own glade file as requested
	by Robert Love.

	* src/compiler.h: Add this file to hold all the GCC4 check ifdefs.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/Makefile.am: Update glade file reference.
	Remove the information page refresher stuff and move to gpm-info.c

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Use run_bin_program to lauch (all) our
	external programs.
	Also coalesce all the custom functions in (menu_main_create) to use
	just menu_add_action_item (which lets us group the callbacks too)
	Also fix so the seporator is shown...

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}: Add run_bin_program to allow us to run
	g-p-p and the new g-p-i (to come... :-) programs.

	* doc/*: Update so www has it's own directory, and move down html into
	a lower level doxygen directory.

2005-10-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.7. Add in Doxygen configure logic.

	* docs/code: New directory for the Doxygen generated pages

2005-10-02  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.6.1

	* src/gpm-idle.c (gpm_idle_update): Don't return FALSE is timeout is
	set to zero, as the polling will stop. The polling needs to continue
	in case the value is changed in g-conf.

	* src/gpm-notification.c (gtk_icon_theme_fallback): Do the icon
	fallback is a more robust way (so sizes are unimportant).
	(create_icon_pixbuf): Return the pixmap for type POWER_AC_ADAPTER.
	Fixes problems reported by Dumitru Ciobarcianu.

2005-10-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-idle.c (update_idle_function): Actually print the return
	value of gscreensaver_get_idle ();
	Also check the value of the timeout to check it's not set to zero.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Moved callback_gconf_key_changed () to
	src/gpm-main.c so we can do clever stuff. Not sure why it was ever in
	this file in the first place...

	* src/gpm-main.c: Fix two typos in the gconf keys threshold_low and
	threshold_critical, and one thinko in the order of calculating the
	old and new charges. The warnings and auto-action should now work
	again now. Found as a co-incidence of running out of battery power...
	(callback_gconf_key_changed): Add case where g-p-p should force an
	update to dmps_suspend without having to change state.
	Reported by Theetjuh <theetjuh@gmail.com>.

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-idle.c: Add in the full idle functionality,
	so that we can either suspend or hibernate when we are deemed idle.

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c: setThrottleEnabled now doesn't return us a value.
	Fix our calling function to also return the value of getIdleTime,
	rather than just the success.

	* docs/gnome_power_manager.php, docs/gnome_power_preferences.php:
	Add a couple of new images and update the text a bit.

	* src/glibhal-extras.c: Return a success value, and pass in steps by
	reference.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: make sure hscale_batteries_display and
	hscale_ac_display are set to 5 minute divisions.
	Also, only set the LCD slider points if we have LCD hardware.
	This removes a warning on desktop systems.

2005-09-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.5.4

	* src/gpm-common.c (get_widget_position): new function to get center
	point of a widget.

	* src/gpm-libnotify.c: Added back (in a better way) the
	libnotify-points-to-icon feature.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Turn on DPMS if not enabled at start.

	* src/gpm-screensaver.c: Attempt to get return val right.

	* src/gpm-idle.c: Do not continue to poll gnome-screensaver if the
	first call failed. This will avoid a warning every minute.

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-notification.c: Use the new libnotify
	widget centering functionality.

	* src/*.c: Use new the macros G_GNUC_WARNUNCHECKED for a few vital
	functions (where we MUST check the return value), and then fix up
	all my sloppy programming...

2005-09-29  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.5.3

	* src/glibhal-extras.c (hal_is_laptop): Factor out this code into it's
	own function so we can use it in a different way...

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (gtk_set_label): Make a simple wrapper...

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (refresh_info_page) Make a function to populate the
	new "Information" tab present in the glade file.

	* src/preferences.glade: Add the new "Information" tab with system
	information. This is all very immature, and likely to change.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (combo_setup_dynamic),
	src/gpm-main.c (get_policy_string): Make sure we check for a null
	gconf return string. This was reported by Myk Melez <myk@mozilla.org>
	where the gconf schema installation was incorrect. This means we
	shouldn't trigger the assert in gpm_common.c (convert_string_to_policy).

2005-09-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-libnotify.{c|h}: Factor out the notification stuff into
	these two new files.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-prefs.c: use the new libnotify stuff and
	delete the local functions which do the same thing.
	Also fix desktops that do not have an LCD panel. Oops.

	* src/*.{c|h}: I've audited these files and added complete NULL
	dereference assert checks, and made sure *all* local pointers are
	always setup with deault value NULL. This may break stuff, but will
	make debugging easier.

	* src/gpm-notification.c (callback_about_activated): Use the
	gtk_about_dialog functionality instead of replying on depreciated
	functionality. Also add GNU licence and the translators.

2005-09-26  Robert Love  <rml@novell.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c: Daemonize by default, via daemon(3).  Add
	  "--no-daemon" flag.

2005-09-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-idle.c, src/gpm-screensaver.{c|h},
	src/glibhal-extras.c, .cvsignore, src/Makefile.am: Fix build warnings.
	Patch from Robert Love <rml@novell.com>, Many thanks.

	schema, and use @VERSION@ to make my life easier.

	* docs/compile.php, docs/faq.php: Add new information

	* src/glibhal-extras.c (hal_get_brightness_item): New function, to
	get the LCD brightness value.
	(hal_set_brightness_dim): New function, allows us to dim the screen
	slowly, rather than one big jump.
	We now support ONLY the new SetBrightness HAL API in HAL CVS.
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.hal/3280

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Remove some #if 0 stuff.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: make the new functionality of format_value_callback_percent_lcd () so the slider can step only to allowed values.

	* src/preferences.glade: Make percentages have no decimal points.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Use the hal_set_brightness_dim functionality.

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.5.1

2005-09-22  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@novell.com>

2005-09-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-common.{c|h}: remove unused function
	convert_powerdevice_to_gnomeicon.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: remove the LCD sub menu as the icons have
	now gone. This belongs in an applet, if at all.

	* gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Add back the libnotify stuff as we are
	not building locally for redhat, and we provide libnotify rpm's.

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.4.

	* src/gpm-main.c : Add info to check the FAQ page before reporting
	emailing me with bugs.

	* src/gpm-notification.c : Change #if to #if defined(foo) to shut up
	GCC's extra warnings. Add note about running on a desktop machine.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c : Add config.h - this was causing libnotify not to
	be defined.
	Also add gpm_is_on_ac () so we can jumpstart g-p-m if not running, and

	<mkastelik@gmail.com> - Many thanks.

	* configure.in: add pl translation.

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: Make docbook2man a automatic configurable.

	hal-glib.c, hal-glib.h: Fix up *lots* of compiler warnings, and make
	more C99 compliant. Also refactored code a little.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Add --version switch to just print the version.

	* doc/report_bug.php: New file, how to file a perfect bug.

2005-09-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.1
	Add new Italian translation by Daniele Medri <daniele@medri.org>.

	* src/gpm-common.h, gpm-main.c: s/LCDPanel/LaptopPanel to match HAL CVS.
	Move g-p-p enums to gpm-prefs.h.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Fix a problem for Andrew Duggan where the incorrect
	ACPI reading was tripping up our over-zealous checks. I've removed the
	check that was the issue, which should hopefully fix the issue.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Move get_devices_capability and
	get_devices_capability_with_value to src/hal-glib.c (
	hal_num_devices_of_capability, hal_num_devices_of_capability_with_value)
	Also do s/POLICY_NONE/POLICY_SLEEP.

	src/hal-glib.c: s/LCDPanel/LaptopPanel to match HAL CVS.

	src/preferences.glade: Fix combobox_sleep_type, and move to options tab.

2005-08-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/icons/gnome-power-system-ups-{0..8}-of-8.png: Added back by
	popular request.

	* NEWS: Update.

	* src/icons/Makefile.am: Add UPS icons.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: use UPS icons. Also fix a bug where {junk}%
	was dislayed when primary battery not present.

2005-08-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.0, signifying the obsolete of PowerManager.
	Also raise hal dep to 0.5.4

	* src/gpm-main.c: Remove code using USE_POWERMANAGER.

	* gnome-power-manager.schemas.in: Use "halt -s", not shutdown.

	* doc/faq.php: Explain the obsolete PowerManager.

	* gnome-power-manager.spec.in: Add "Obsoletes: PowerManager" so that
	we uninstall the PowerManager Daemon.

2005-08-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/preferences.glade: Fix the combobox padding, and make all siders
	update policy to "continous" so we can do some clever stuff with steps.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Rename capability to lcdpanel.

	* src/gpm-main.c: fix a warning for:
	"g_value_set_uint: assertion `G_VALUE_HOLDS_UINT (value)' failed"
	by switching to return a G_TYPE_UINT value.

	* src/gpm-main: (hal_set_brightness, hal_set_brightness_item):
	Create new functions to support the new
	org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.LCDPanel.SetBrightness method.

	* src/gpm-common.h: Add HAL_DBUS_INTERFACE_LCD

	* src/hal-glib.{c|h}: Move hal specificy code into here from gpm-main.

	* src/gpm-prefs: (format_value_callback_percent): Set to 1 digit
	precision, e.g. 56.3% so we can do steps.

	* src/gpm-prefs: (callback_hscale_changed): Add divisions support so
	we can lock to correct values for LCD brightness.
	This also lets us snap to 5 minute intervals for the sleep hscale's.

2005-08-26  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* doc/compile.php: Add information about CVS and Fedora core, and
	Fedora rawhide.

	* doc/faq.php, doc/menu.php, doc/index.css: Add FAQ page.

2005-08-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-common.c: removed update_percentage_charge as we now depend on
	CVS HAL.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Remove all code paths that rely on !CVSHAL.

2005-08-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/preferences.glade: removed the user setting of
	hard drive spindown time, and double click action.
	This was agued by many as having no place in the UI.

	* src/gpm-main.c (hal_setlowpowermode): add a new funtion to call
	SetPowerSave on the HAL root computer object.

	* Makefile.am: Use the new define, DBUS_SYS_DIR

	* configure.in: Add configuration for DBUS_SYS_DIR and DBUS_SERVICES_DIR
	I hope these don't break the RPM :-)

	* gnome-power-manager.service.in: new file, will act as a future service
	file for the dbus service.

2005-08-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* po/*.po, src/gpm-main.c: Changed explaination to explanation.

2005-08-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (update_has_logic): removed as we can trivially move the
	remaining checks into the state check function.
	Fix detection of onBatteryPower so that it's instantaneous.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (get_devices_capability_with_value): New function, so
	that we can match a capability with a key string. Useful for buttons
	and ide drives.

2005-08-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Make the gnome-power.foo files into gnome-power-manager.foo files.
	CVS churn...

	* src/gpm-common.h, src/hal-glib.c, src/hal-glib.h, src/gpm-main.c: Make
	hal_device_get_* to return success value rather than data so we can
	test for the tag not existing. This is needed for CVSHAL.
	Also add hal_free_capability convenience function.

	* src/gpm-prefs.c, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-common.h: Start getting rid of has*
	gconf data keys	- all that remain are hasBatteries and hasAcAdaptor -
	also need to make proper the solution in gpm-prefs w.r.t. the
	button handling.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in: Remove all the has* keys as we are not setting
	or reading these values now.

2005-08-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.c, src/gpm-main.c, gpm-notification.h, src/gpm-common.h:
	Add a warning when show_icon is set to false.
	Remove the struct IconData as the show and show_if_full gconf values
	can now be read for each icon refresh as they are quick. The global
	variable main_icon could be reduced in scope to one function, so I did
	that too.
	Remove the setupData field as we can now set GPM_SIMULATE (instead of
	doActions) and verbose is just a global now.

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Removed the ability to generate our own icons,
	so we'll rely on the packaged ones. This desision wasn't taken lightly,
	but a11y considerations meant this had to be removed.

	* src/gpm-common.h: Add the HAL dbus defines.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Start adding the CVS HAL method support in. Also
	un-#if the GSCREENSAVER stuff - worst case we get a dbus warning if
	not present.

	* gnome-power.spec.in, doc/index.html: Bump to dep of hal 0.5.4

	* src/gpm-dbus-test.c: s/GPM_DBUS_POWEROFF/GPM_DBUS_SHUTDOWN to match.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in: Add general/cmd_reboot and
	general/cmd_shutdown so that we can get rid of PowerManager.

	* doc/index.html: Remove pmscripts as this has been taken over with
	pm-utils carried upstream.

2005-08-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gnome-power.schemas.in: Remove /apps/gnome-power/lockdown/* as we can
	now use hald. Remove /apps/gnome-power-manager/policy/UPSCritical as we
	can use BatteryCritical. Improved lots of short descriptions.
	Do s/gnome-power/gnome-power-manager and s/AC/ac and
	s/Batteries/batteries (and convert StudlyCaps to usual_style) so that
	we are more consistant as a Gnome application. Fixes suggested by
	David Zeuthen.

	* src/gpm-notification.c, src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-common.h: remove
	lockdown stuff,	and also use the new gconf keynames.

	* gpm-prefs.c: Remove combobox_ups_critical

	* TODO: Update.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Remove the GPMGLIB stuff as we don't compile anymore
	with !GPMGLIB thanks to all the new code.
	Also refactored the signal stuff into nice inline functions.

2005-08-16  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.{c|h}: Now the GLIB signal stuff is working,
	remove these empty files. The GLIB dbus stuff allows us to clean up the
	source substantially. I will be making the GPMGLIB stuff enforced,
	i.e. removing compatability with the older dbus's.

	* src/gpm-main.c (action_policy_do): New function (gscreensaver_lock).
	Add the commands to lock the screen using gnome-screensaver. Thanks to
	Diego González for the basis for this patch.

	* src/gpm-common.h: Add the GS_DBUS_SERVICE, GS_DBUS_PATH, and
	GS_DBUS_INTERFACE defines here.

2005-08-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Apply patch from Steev Klimaszewski to change a TIMOUT to TIMEOUT
	- which I blame entirely on this laptop keyboard.

	* configure.in: Add --enable-gscreensaver to configure arguments so that
	we do not try to read in the gconf values and throw an error if this
	program is not built. We still need to write the auto check for
	gnome-screensaver in configure.in. Spotted by Steev Klimaszewski.

	* src/gpm-main.c, src/gpm-main.c: Sprinkle with #if HAVE_GSCREENSAVER
	so that we disable the un-needed parts.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.c: Fix the PowerManager interface line. Note that
	this file is going when we go 100% glib.
	Also PowerManager support is going when HAL gets event support (soon).

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Remove setup.hasQuit and setup.hasActions and
	the associated logic.

2005-08-14  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Update src/pixmaps/gnome-dev-acadapter.png so that it matches the
	"dfong" bluecurve theme.

	* gpm-main.c: Continue playing with LIBHAL_EXPERIMENT so that we can
	remove the libhal dep and use the pure glib bindings. With this we are
	uncovering lots of problems with the glib dbus bindings and so is a good
	thing :-) If you use LIBHAL_EXPERIMENT then please use CVS dbus, else
	little will work. Thanks to davidz and walters for all the help so far.

	* src/gpm_marshal.list: Added marshal file for use by glib-genmarshal

	* src/Makefile.am: Add support for gpm_marshall.c and gpm_marshall.h

2005-08-09  Maxim Dziumanenko <mvd@mylinux.ua>

	* configure.in: Added "uk" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-08-04  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gpm-common.h: Add GPMURL define

	* gpm-dbus-common.{c|h}: Remove the signal stuff we don't use and we
	now use the glib method stuff unconditionally, so remove them.

	* gpm-main.c: Use the libnotify glib initialisation stuff.
	Also start experimenting with GLIB methods.

	* gpm-prefs.c: Use the libnotify glib initialisation stuff.

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.1

	* Makefile.am: Add the glib glue stuff.

2005-07-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gnome-power-service.xml: Comment out stuff we are not using.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Continue playing with glib.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.{c|h}: Remove the obsolete method functions
	Signals are next on the hit-list.

2005-07-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/hal-glib.c, src/hal-glib.h: new files for the glib libhal functions

	* src/Makefile.am: add hal-glib.{c|h} into the build.

	* src/gpm-main.c: use the glib libhal functions as it makes everything
	easier to read and debug.

	* src/gpm-main.c (pm_do_action, set_hdd_spindown_device): Communicate
	with PowerManager using the glib bindings. Try and initialise as much
	as we can with dbus-glib. Notice a trend?

	* src/gpm-main.h: put all constants in gpm-common.c

	* Makefile.am: Remove Makefile.in's on maintainer-clean

	* src/gnome-power-service.xml: Update without the veto prefix,
	and add signals - this will prepare for the glib bindings in the future.

2005-07-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Make sure we only use GCONF_ROOT once.
	Add libnotify box informing user that they do not have gnome-screensaver
	DPMS support.

	* src/gpm-common.h: Move NOTIFY_TIMOUT here.

	* src/gpm-main.c: Remove invalid gconf check.
	Added support for writing /apps/gnome-screensaver/dpms_suspend for
	gnome-screensaver.

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/gpm-notification.c,
	src/prefs.c: Make libnotify a configurable build option, on the advice
	of David Zeuthen.

	* gnome-power.spec.in: Add --enable-libnotify.

2005-07-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gnome-power.spec.in: Do not restart messagebus on install

	* src/gnome-power-service.xml: new file, prepare for dbus glib'ification.
	We will be able to remove lots of code when we use the glib bindings.

2005-07-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-dbus-test.c: Added back the NameOwnerChanged signals.
	Add some #ifdefs to allow test.c to use gpm-dbus-common.h
	Added some help text in the --help screen.

2005-07-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* README, docs/index.html: updated dep information.

	* src/preferences.glade: Add some new sexy stuff.

2005-07-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* dbus-interface.html: Removed as information is more up to date in docs/

	* autogen.sh: Changed to use gnome-common

	* src/sounds/critial.wav: New sound file from GAIM for critical notification

	* src/sounds/normal.wav: New sound file from Iagno for other notifications

	* src/gpm-main.c (use_libnotify): Now do a sound for the notifications.
	I don't think libnotify supports this yet, but when it does, this should
	"just-work" :-)

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (recalc): Add support for missing lid/power/sleep buttons.
	Also add the GCONF_ROOT prefix to the keys manually, so we can use
	gnome-screensaver ones in the future.

	* src/preferences.glade: Name the labels so that the above works correctly.

	* gnome-power.spec.in: Add gnome-common dep, and update others.

	* configure.in: Add src/sounds/Makefile and src/icons/Makefile

	* src/sounds/Makefile.am: New file, to add the wave files.

	* src/icons/Makefile.am: New file, and move over the icons. This means we
	can install different icon sets, e.g. bluecurve, gnome or LowContrast if
	people don't like the icons.

	* src/gpm-notification.c (callback_about_activated): No point displaying
	"Unknown Translator" for un-translated files.

2005-07-20  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/pixmaps/gnome-power-system*.png: New icons thanks to Diana Fong
	and David Zeuthen. They look great - thanks!

	* docs/images/*.png: Update screenshots to a bit more recent.

	* src/gpm-notification.c (get_icon_position): New function, tell libnotify
	where to point to. This is a bit rough-and-ready at the moment but seems to
	work well.

	* src/gpm-main.c (use_libnotify): Now setting an image with position, lets
	see what people think.

	* src/gpm-dbus-server.c (dbus_method_handler): Add in all the existing
	signals as methods. dbus-glib, where for art thou. :-)

	* src/gpm-dbus-server.c (dbus_signal_filter): Removed support for the
	signal API.

2005-07-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/pixmaps/gnome-power.png: New file (we now have an icon thanks to
	Diana Fong)

	* src/pixmaps/Makefile.am: Added gnome-power.png

	* configure.in: We now require dbus-glib-0.35.2 (an unpopular move).
	I want to use the new glib bindings throughout the programs. There is too
	many dbus wrapper-type functions that add to bloat and make the program
	generally difficult to read. After reading the dbus-glib sample code,
	I'm sure this is the way to go. For all you FC4 users, rawhide's DBUS seems
	to work well with no ill effects.

	* doc/*: Updated documentation with new logo, and a few new screenshots.

	* src/gpm-dbus-test.c: Converted to just use the glib bindings - this file
	is a bit of a mess at the moment, but you see the plan. I'm thinging making
	ACK, NACK etc, into methods instead of signals. Methods seem more the right
	thing to use, so I'll start converting gpm-dbus-server.c to accept these
	methods instead.

	* src/gpm-dbus-server.c: Add in method support for ACK, others to follow.

2005-07-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Changed module name to gnome-power-manager to better
	reflect the gnome module name. The next release will have a tarball
	gnome-power-manager.tar.gz instead of gnome-power.tar.gz

	* src/pixmaps/Makefile.am: New file, splitting from src/Makefile.am -
	I should have done this a long time ago.

	* Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am: Tidy up, and move the build of
	preferences.glade to src/ - it never belonged here anyway.
	Also, we'll now use /usr/share/gnome-power-manager to be more specific.

2005-07-18  Adam Weinberger  <adamw@gnome.org>

	* configure.in: Added en_CA to ALL_LINGUAS. I think it's important
	  right now to note that nearly every single source string in the
	  entire program has at least one grammar or spelling error.

2005-07-17  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Made eggtrayicon a global, and got rid of the
	complicated icon->td structure. We don't need to be so complicated now
	we only have one icon.

	* src/*dbus*.c: Added note that we will be changing to glib bindings soon.

	* TODO: updated.

2005-07-17  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@redfoxcenter.org>

	* configure.in: Added "fr" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-07-16  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* configure.in: Added "sv" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-07-15  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-dbus-server.c (vetoActionUnregisterInterest): Add an option so we
	can supress the error (for random client disconnections)

	* src/gpm-prefs.c (main): set hscale_battery_critical on load, not just on
	change,	else we get the slider changing in unpredictable ways.

	* src/gpm-*.c: s/g_assert/g_return_if_fail and g_return_val_if_fail
	This will make the programs a little more error friendly (we still get
	critical errors, but the program doesn't die)

	* src/gpm-notification.c: Finish removing the low_icon mess.

	* src/gpm-notification.c (callback_about_activated): Added translatable
	string "Unknown Translator" for all you translators to get a bit of credit.

2005-07-15  Terance Sola  <terance@lyse.net>

	* configure.in: Added "nb" and "no" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-07-14  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gnome-power.preferences.desktop.in:
	Replace "GNOME Power Preferences" with "Power Preferences" - we shouldn't
	have "GNOME" in the Preferences menu title.

	* src/gpm-main.c (read_battery_data): Re-arrange the initialisation to
	known defaults so that valgrind doesn't get upset with a UPS attached.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in: Added criticalThreshold value

	* gpm-prefs.c (callback_hscale_changed): Add in new code for
	criticalThreshold, and make sure that criticalThreshold > lowThreshold
	by changing the limits of the criticalThreshold slider.

	* src/gpm-main.c (property_modified): Added notification and action for
	battery critical. Now we are cooking with gas.
	p.s. Thanks to the translators for all the recent work. Appreciated.

2005-07-15  Abel Cheung  <maddog@linuxhall.org>

	* configure.in: Added "mk" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-07-13  Francisco Javier F. Serrador  <serrador@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in Added to LINGUAS "es" and missing  "pa" and "zh_CN".

2005-07-13  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Add check for libnotify.

	* src/gpm-common.c: Add initial code for libnotify support. Patches for
	libnotify and DBUS 0.33 have been sent upstream, along with a spec file
	for FC4. Ubuntu is also packaging this in the next few weeks, so the
	extra dep shouldn't be a problem.

	* src/gpm-main.c (use_libnotify): new function, convenience. Added lots more
	notifications where we used to have dialogues, for the warning states.

	* src/gpm-common.c (property_modified): Fix bug where update_state_logic
	was being called with coldplug TRUE, when it quite plainly isn't.

	* src/gpm-common.c (get_timestring_from_minutes): Fix translationable string
	to be constant number. Fix from Hendrik Brandt, thanks.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Change tense of a description to be less like the
	borg :-) Fix from Hendrik Brandt, thanks.

	* doc/*: Added lots more information and other images.

	* src/preferencs.glade: Name the new label label_double_click so we can
	disable it :-)

	* src/gpm-prefs.c: Disable the double click stuff for now

	* src/gpm-main.c (property_modified): Add the code where the user is
	informed of the low battery state. This works for any rechargeable device.

2005-07-12  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-main.c (set_hdd_spindown): New stub function that sets the
	spindown for all hard-drives attached to the system.

	* MAINTAINERS, README.cvs: new files, needed for movement to GNOME CVS
	servers. I'll update the help when they allow anonymous checkouts.

	* doc/*: New folder with quite a bit of documentation in HTML form.

2005-07-12  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.c (create_icon_pixbuf): Use the new icons
	for system-wide power state so it's much easier to theme

	* src/Makefile.am:
	(Data_DATA): Add pixmaps/gnome-power-system[-ac]-[0-8]-of-8.png

	* src/pixmaps/gnome-power-system[-ac]-[0-8]-of-8.png: New files

2005-07-11  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* gnome-power.spec.in : Added depend of PowerManager - this is now the
	only way we can call root scripts. PowerManager is only a temp fix,
	HAL will have the required actions soon.
	Fedora Extras fixes from Andreas Thienemann, thanks!

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Removed the scripts/ gconf directory.
	Removed the ShowIconLow boolean as we don't support this anymore.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.c : Add convert_dbus_enum_to_string () so we can make
	the interactive prompts more user-friendly.

	* src/gpm-dbus-list.c : Removed, as we can use the dbus tools instead.

	gnome-power-manager.sgml, gnome-power-preferences.sgml : New files from
	Oliver Grawert <ogra@ubuntu.com> for man support. Still need to fill these
	in to be complete, and up to date (and to patch Makefile and spec) but
	I've uploaded them so people can see them and improve them.

2005-07-07 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.h : Renamed net.sf.PowerManager to
	net.sf.GnomePower so we can use a desktop agnostic backend.
	Add PM_DBUS_INTERFACE as a test.

	* src/gpm-dbus-common.h : Create pm_do_action () as a test using PM_DBUS.

2005-07-04 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* dbus-interface.html : New file, detailing the DBUS interface and
	progress.

	* src/gpm-dbus-server.c : Continue to impliment the spec (above)

	* src/gpm-dbus-test.c : Start writing lots of tests so we can really
	pound the PowerManager DBUS interface.

	* src/gpm-main.c : Now does action ACPower fail. Noticed by Ow Mun Heng.

	* .cvsignore, po/.cvsignore, src/.cvsignore : New files to help me
	keep on top of the CVS directories.

2005-07-02 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-dbus-test.[c|h] New files for test DBUS service.
	* src/gpm-dbus-list.[c|h] New files for test DBUS service.
	* src/gpm-dbus-server.[c|h] New files for test DBUS service.
	* src/gpm-dbus-test.[c|h] New files for test DBUS service.
	* gnome-power.conf : New DBUS conf file
	(belongs in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/)

	* src/Makefile.am : Added the above files to build the new DBUS bits.

	* src/clipboard.{c|h} : Removed these files as we can use DBUS for
	startup checking.

	* Makefile.am : Installed /etc/dbus-1/system.d/gnome-power.conf
	* gnome-power.spec.in : Install /etc/dbus-1/system.d/gnome-power.conf
	and restart messagebus.

2005-07-01 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm-notification.c : Removed the low icon code in prep for
	DavidZ and Andrei's patches. Code is simpler and less complicated.
	Also created create_virtual_of_type() to play with. May be usefull for
	multi-instance devices like batteries where we want to average the values.

2005-06-30 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/prefs.glade : split some options into a new tab.

	* src/gpm-notification.c : After discussing with Paul Ionescu, I've
	created the new funtion get_percentagecharge_batteries () that
	understands multibattery setups. Hopefully this should be useful.
	Also made this function work. += is the correct line, =+ is incorrect!

	* src/gpm-notification.c : Also added the new functions
	get_tooltip_state () and get_object_tooltip () which will hopefully
	help the work Andrei is doing with the new left click menu.

2005-06-28 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Makefile.am : Fix typo that was tripping up intltool-*
	* src/Makefile.am : Add *.h files so that we pass make distcheck
	Patches from Andrew Duggan - thanks.

2005-06-27 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* PATCH: Converted names to be clearer on advice of Jaap Haitsma:
	common 	-> 	gpm-common
	gpm 	-> 	gpm-main
	gpn 	-> 	gpm-notification
	prefs 	-> 	gpm-prefs

	You can get the old versions using:
	http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/almstrum/cs373/general/cvsguide.html#revision

	* Removed icons.{c|h} as we don't need stub functions.

2005-06-22 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpn.{h|c} : Add showIfFull to IconData struct so we can update
	on the fly.

	* src/prefs.c : Fix a bug where we automatically overwrite the value of
	displayIconFull and displayIconLow (to true) on g-p-p startup.

	* src/Makefile.am : Remove discharging.png as it's no longer part of
	the build.

	* src/gpn.c : new function get_object_of_powertype () - helps us with
	the displayIconFull problem. We should do the right thing with the
	main icon now. Reported by Paul Ionescu - Thanks.

2005-06-21 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/common.c : Add POWER_AC_ADAPTER to convert_powerdevice_to_gnomeicon

	* src/gpm.c (add_ac_adapter) : Make sure we set struct fields
	(like isRechargeable) to a known value. Fixes the problem of a desktop
	showing an ac_adapter icon with an overlay.
	Also create a new funtion (read_battery_data)to seporate creating the
	battery object and populating it. Solves the crash at boot with no
	batteries inserted. We can also populate known data if the battery isn't
	present like we did for ac_adapter.
	Reported by Paul Ionescu. - Thanks.

	* src/Makefile.am : Change ac_adapter.png to gnome-dev-acadapter.png

2005-06-19 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* po/de.po : New file - translation from Hendrik Brandt - thanks!

	* src/{gpm|prefs|gpn|common}.c : Mark some strings translatable

	* po/POTFILES.in : Add the above files for translation.

	* configure.in : add translation de.

	* src/gpn.c : Add initial LCD work, but don't enable it yet.

2005-06-19 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/{gpm|prefs|gpn}.c : replace /apps/gnome-power/ with GCONF_ROOT

	* src/common.c : make some simple functions return gchar rather than
	GString to speed them up. We don't need to be overly clever for no gain.
	Removed convert_powerdevice_to_haltype () as unused.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Add /apps/gnome-power/general/displayIconFull
	so we can ignore a fully charged device. Requested as feature.
	Also add:
	/schemas/apps/gnome-power/lockdown/{shutdown|suspend|hibernate|reboot}
	so we can use sabayon to lock down users to not do specific things.
	Distros can use this (e.g. Fedora) if they consider an action dangerous.
	We could use HAL in the future for this information, and we definatly
	need to work out what the hardware can do. No point displaying
	"Hibernate" if the machine is of type APM, for instance.

	* src/prefs.c : Added variable displayIconFull and added in checks for
	the new checkbox checkbutton_display_icon_full.

	* src/common.h : Added lockdown stuff to SetupData.

	* src/gpm.c, src/gpn.c : Read in lockdown information to SetupData, and
	apply when needed. Only refreshed on program invocation as the data
	isn't going to change frequently, if at all.

2005-06-18 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in : Bump to 0.0.6 as I released 0.0.5 today.

	* src/prefs.c : Remove the horror that was getPolicyFromWidgetname ()
	- replace with sexy g_object pointers.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Add /schemas/apps/gnome-power/scripts/
	{shutdown|suspend|hibernate|reboot} after talking to David Zeuthen about
	HAL events (which might not be used on all distros/archs..)
	We can always use:
		dbus-send --system --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal  \
		/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer \
		org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.SystemPower.Suspend
	When HAL event support is added, this can be patched in by distros.

	* src/common.h : Added ACTION_REBOOT

	* src/gpn.c : Added callback_actions_activated so we can get some
	callbacks for the actions such as "Shutdown"
	Also add menu_add_separator_item to split the menu up a bit,
	Add menu_add_action_item's for all the states. At the moment all the
	states are shown (irrespective to whether supported) but this is mainly
	for my testing.

	* src/Makefile.am, src/pixmaps/gnome-* : Add icons for actions.

	* src/common.c, src/prefs.c : Remove stdio.h includes as not required.

	* src/info.c : Removed as unused.

	* src/gpm.c : Added call to g_type_init () as some users were getting:
	GLib-GObject-CRITICAL **: gtype.c:2254: initialization assertion failed,
	use IA__g_type_init() prior to this function.
	- lets hops this fixes it.

	* src/gnome-power.spec.in : Fixed a typo where integer should be int.

2005-06-16 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c, src/common.c : valgrind doesn't like "Conditional jump or
	move depends on uninitialised value(s)" when ->present is assumed true.
	Add check in add_ac_adapter () just use the ->percentageCharge directly.

	* src/gpn.c (create_icon_pixbuf) : Use gtk_icon_info_free () as we
	leak memory otherwise. Thanks valgrind.

	* src/gpm.c : Add check for battery.charge_level.rate so we don't spew
	g_message's.

2005-06-15 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/*.[ch] : Fix from David Zeuthen to get rid of DOS newlines.
	The moral of the story is not to email yourself code from outlook.

	* src/*.[ch] : Add in GPLv2 text to make licencing clearer.

	* src/*.c : Make code better fit in 80 char line.

	* src/gpm.c : Remove UPS hack as patch is upstream.

	* src/logger.* : Removed these files as we are swiching to glib
	based logging.

	* src/gpn.c, src/gpm.c, src/common.c, src/icons.c, src/prefs.c : Switch
	to g_log functions from GPM_ type macros. Smaller code, yay.

	* src/common.c : New function, g_log_ignore (this will ignore messages
	for us when non-verbose)

2005-06-13 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpn.c, src/gpm.c, src/common.c, src/icons.c, src/prefs.c :
	Remove "!= NULL" from g_assert statements as not needed.

	* Added code from Andrei Yurkevich for dynamic icons,
	e.g. icons that do not have the colour bar hardcoded. Big thank you.

	* src/gpn.c : New functions: level_bar_get_color, create_icon_pixbuf

	* src/icons.c : new function: icon_modify_image_pixbuf

	* src/common.c : New function: convert_powerdevice_to_gnomeicon
	Removed : get_icon_filename, get_powerstate_discrete

	* src/Makefile.am : Remove all the icons, and move some to pixmaps,
	also removed reference to object_table.c

	* src/icons/* : Removed thanks to Andrei!

	* src/pixmaps/* : Removed existing, replaced with GNOME default
	device icons so we are portable without complicated
	configue.in checks.

	* src/gpn.* : Removed filename field as it's not needed.

	* src/object_table.* : removed array functions, g_ptr_array is quick
	and more efficient than an array ,and gives us smaller, more
	elegant code.

	* src/common.h : removed MAX_ICONS for good :-)

	* configure.in : Bumped version to 0.0.5 (as we have had a
	LOT of new code in the last few weeks)

2005-05-31 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpn.c, src/gpn.c : New files - takes the notification
	functions out of gpm.c and make it more manageable in size.
	For the moment, use shared variables (no need for IPC as we
	are still one program..)

	* src/gpm.c : Convert to use the new gpn_ functions provided
	by gpn.c - also allow us to use the new constants ICON_MAIN,
	ICON_LOW and ICON_ALL.

2005-05-29 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/object_table.c : make object_table_find return void, and
	convert slotData to NULL if we do not find object - this will
	trigger the g_assert'ion, rather than seg-faulting in
	gpm.c:property_modified

	* src/gpm.c : To prevent g_assert'ing when first adding an
	ac_adapter after we have booted, add ac_adapter
	unconditionaly on present state.

2005-05-25 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c : Add new functon "powerDeviceToHalType" to convert
	the powerDevice to the HAL name.
	Get action_policy_do working again, so that *Shutdown* events
	are triggered.
	Simplify property_modified so that we only check battery* and
	ac_adapter* keys. Also BUG when we can't find the device, as
	this signifies a bug in HAL.

	* src/icons/primary* : Rename the battery- icons to primary to
	avoid confusion with other types of batteries (this lets us use
	powerDeviceToHalType and simplify getIconFilenameFromSlot)

	* src/icons/pda*-c|-d* : Create the PDA charging/discharging
	icons so we could use them in the future if we wish.

	* src/Makefile.am : Add new PDA icons, and stop installing
	icons that we no longer use!

	* src/*.c : Changed some StudlyCaps function names to be more
	C-like, and consistant e.g.
	"getHoursStringFromMinutes" -> "get_timestring_from_minutes"
	Also changed a lot of int's to gint's and chars to gchars for
	glib portibility (makes no difference at the moment).

2005-05-25 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/common.c, src/common.h, src/gpm.c : Add a patch from
	Andrei Yurkevich for PDA support, see http://synce.sf.net
	for the hal-addon. Thanks!

	* src/common.c : refactored a lump of code to the function
	HalTypeToPowerDevice to abstract gpm.c a little.

2005-05-17 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c : AC_ADAPTER should not be a valid choice for
	icon_low - check for this. Also document a few functions while
	I'm here.

2005-05-16 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c, src/common.c, src/icons.c, src/prefs.c : Add a
	load of g_assert's to try and find all the funny crashes and get
	rid of the unneeded error paths where abort would be the best
	solution.

	* src/gpm.c : Be a lot more careful with freeing memory.
	Remove kludgey string logic in getIconFilenameFromSlot and use
	itegers and %03i format.

	* src/preferences.glade : Add the low threshold slider.

	* src/prefs.c : Support the new slider, adding new callback tools
	and modifying policy lookup function (getPolicyFromWidgetname)

	* src/gpm.c : Make threshold slider dynamically add/remove low icon.

2005-05-14 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c : Fix a segfault in the situation on having no low
	power devices attached. Should also sort the problem of running
	GPM on a PC without any powerdevices, but this I'll have to check.
	Fixed a memory-leak where we were not calling free_icon_structure
	after removing an icon.

2005-05-13 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c : fixed the saving of remaining_time for batteries.
	Rename the function mememe as it's a point of embarrassment. :-)
	Make get_main_tooltip use powerDeviceToString for consistency.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Added lowThreshold to the schema

2005-05-12 Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/common.*, src/gpm.c : FINALLY sorted out the mess that was icon
	and tooltip generation. Next on my list is the actions support which
	is a mess as well. Lots of changes.

	* src/icons.* : Removed the filename parameter from icon_create to
	avoid having to do clever things before creating the icon. This may
	display the GTK broken image for a split second while loading,
	although I can't see it on my laptop at all.

	* src/object_table.c : Removed use of removed properties. Less junk.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Added displayIconLow to the schema

	* src/prefs.c, src/preferences.glade : Added displayIconLow support.

2005-05-11  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/common.* : Got rid of the ACPI calculation as the patch is now
	in HAL CVS that makes time_remaining part of the interface. Nice.

	* src/gpm.c : Got rid of the special case ACPI calculations.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in : Updates policy to reflect what we are
	actually using, and choose some defaults.

	* src/common.c : policyoption_to_enum, enum_to_policyoption :
	new functions to convert the enum ACTION_HIBERNATE into a string
	"hibernate" and vice versa, for use in gconf to prettyfy names.
	Still needs some work.

2005-05-09  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/* : Changed printf => g_print and fprintf(stderr) => GPM_ERROR
	on advice of Jaap Haitsma, thanks.

	* ../hal : Fixed up so that UPS's always set battery.present = TRUE.
	Also making progress on moving battery.time_remaining into HAL, rather
	than the mess of special cases we have in GPM at the moment.

	* src/common.* : New function, powerDeviceToString to make easy work
	of converting a magic number into a human string.

2005-05-08  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/icons.c, src/icons.h : Re-implimented the notification area
	icon destroy/create/modify functions to be more logical and
	segfault friendly as these functions have caused lots of crashes.
	Also made the dropdown menu icon specific rather than global for the
	different types of icon.

	* src/gpm.c : Changed to use new icon functions and misc cleanups.

	* src/common.h : Removed redundant icon checking fields.

	* src/prefs.c : Make the icon checkbox get it's value from gconf.

2005-05-05  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* New frontend according the GNOME HIG (2 weeks work!)

	* Backend displaying multiline tooltip and single icon, unless
	battery device is low (todo!)

	* Begin switching char* functions into GString functions.

2005-04-19  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/preferences.glade : misc grammar/spelling fixes from
	Simon Howard, Thanks!

	* src/icons/ups-*-*.png, src/Makefile.am: New UPS discharge and
	charge icons to match battery.

	* src/common.c : Support new UPS charging and discharging icons.

2005-04-18  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in, NEWS : Bumped version to 0.0.4

	* src/prefs.c : Removed the users ability to show/hide the
	ac-adapter icon as this is going away in 0.0.4

	* src/gpm.c, src/alert.c : Removed the alert checkbox on the
	advice of Paul Ionescu.

	* src/common.c : Removed getFilenameNumberFormat to simplify logic.

	* src/common.h : Added isDischarging property because
	isDischarging != isCharging :-)

	* src/icons/battery-*-*.png, src/Makefile.am: New discharge and
	charge icons, thanks to Paul Ionescu for the mockup and
	David Zeuthen for the idea.

2005-04-07  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c : Fix some seg-faulting goodness when we try to modify
	a tooltip of an icon that was never created.
	Also added lots of function comments.

	* src/prefs.c : Make checkboxes use a SList like the combos.
	This neatens things up, and means gconf policy name doesn't have to
	match the libglade widgetname.
	Made the "help" button lauch a web-browser displaying g-p-m homepage.
	Also added lots of function comments.

2005-04-06  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/Makefile.am : Tidy up, don't include .h files here.

	* src/prefs.c : Got rid of the nasty, nasty arrays.

	* src/prefs.h : New file, just for preferences stuff

2005-04-05  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/gpm.c : Patch from Andrei Yurkevich to fix seg-fault on DBUS
	initialisation, thanks!

	* src/prefs.c : Massive overhaul so that gconf ky name is decoupled
	from libglade name - this lets us choose pretty names in gconf.
	Also made so that lcd_brightness is measured in percent in gconf
	so power-users could make changes without looking up the enum.
	Added error checking and suitable framework.

	* gnome-power.schemas.in, src/gpm.c, src/prefs.c : Make gconf names
	pretty, not ones derived from libglade.

2005-04-04  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/alert.c, src/alert.glade : New files for the about dialogue for
	battery low notification.

	* src/Makefile.am, Makefile.am : added information for gnome-power-alert,
	Uncommented the gconf install line, install .desktop file.

	* src/pixmaps/* : Added new icons with battery icons superimposed.

	* src/common.*, src/gpm.* : Removed .enabled from the struct, now using
	POWER_NONE to signify that there is no device. Also done lots more checking
	for NULL for the slotBase structures being passed around.

	* gnome-power-preferences.desktop.in : New file, create launcher to modify
	GNOME Power Preferences from the GNOME system menu.

	* gnome-power.spec.in : First version of the RPM spec, based mainly on
	GNOME Volume Manager's spec file. Produces RPM's ok, I think.

2005-04-03  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* autogen.sh : Made to automatically run ./configure on the advice of
	Jaap Haitsma.

	* src/gpm.c src/common.c : Add tweaks, and start to make interface suitable
	for DBUS.

	* src/common.h, src/icons.h, src/object_table.h : Split prototypes for
	header files to clean up include mess.

2005-04-01  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/logger.c, src/logger.h : New files for logging
	Shamelessly copied from hald, by David Zeuthen

	* src/gpm.c, src/common.c : Updated to better support Logitech mice and
	changed all the printing to stdout to use the new logging functions.

	* src/gpm.c, src/prefs.c, src/common.h, src/preferences.glade :
	Implemented the /icons/icon* gconf properties so that users can hide
	or show icons.

	* src/common.h : Removed type for battery, now we'll use a string for speed.

	* Makefile.am : Removed local-build powermanager.c - oops.

2005-03-30  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* doc/ : removed the temporary directory and split into the new
	CVS module www.

	* src2/ : removed the developmental directory and split into the new
	CVS module power-manager. The code is in flux, and probably will
	not compile or run for a while. I'm concentrating on PowerManager before
	I work anymore on the GNOME GUI.

	* www/* : Updated the directory with new php based layout from Jaap.

2005-03-25  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* prefs.c, preferences.glade : rebuild menus...
	New file structure, with tabbed layout and more options. There are
	no schemes now, as they make no logical sense in the current format.

	* g-p-m.schemas.in, added new properties for policy, and removed schemes.

	* docs/index.html, change references to module head to gnome-power
	For GNOME Power Manager to build in jhbuild, the CVS module name must
	be similar to the project. Renamed head to gnome-power.

	* gnome-power.modules, new file:
	Added template for jhbuild users, thanks Jaap Haitsma!

	* TODO, Added list of things to do!
	* NEWS, Added list of releases, well, both of them.
	* README, Added link to website.
	* HACKING, Added plea for help!

2005-03-24  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/common.c, new function : updateLogic()
	This function runs through the old state, calculates the new
	state, then performs and notification actions. It obsoletes
	most of do_action() and all of the hasBatteriesCheck type code.

	* src/gpm.c: Misc, Hooks added to most of the update code to support
	updateLogic (where appropriate).

	* src/common.h: make enums match CodingStyle, also added lots more
	states to the StateData structure to support updateLogic().

	* src/common.c: Made the percentage/mWh calculations more common, and more
	resistant to errors.

	* src/prefs.c: Made the PowerState ComboBox change the others according to
	policy. Also values now populated dynamically, not in the glade file.
	Static policy in use, and documentation has been updated.

2005-03-23  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/prefs.c, new file:  - also imported all the pixmaps into
	cvs and worked trying to connect up all the signals.

	* src/gpm.c: Added new option to drop-down on all the icons for preferences
	dialogue, and set the file to execute.

	* src/common.c: Also added preliminary gconf backend, "Preferences" will
	dynamically adjust it's output depending on the gconf settings.

	* Removed some compiled files that snuck into CVS.

2005-03-22  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* src/properties.glade, new file:
	Added preliminary glade properties file, with thanks to David Zeuthen
	for the original.

	* mkinstalldirs, new file: Add a needed file for "make install". Oops.

2005-03-21  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Initial release of 0.0.2

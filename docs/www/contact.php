<h2>Can you help?</h2>
<p>
Please contact <a href="mailto:richard@hughsie.com">me</a> for any issues, or bugs you find with the GNOME Power Manager.
</p>
<p>
There is also a <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gnome-power-devel">gnome-power-devel mailing list</a>.

<h2>Submitting fixes / enhancements</h2>
<p>
Be sure to add an entry into the ChangeLog file telling me what the patch does and what files are changed.
Also, break any patch files up into logical chunks that are easier to check and apply one-by-one.
</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>
I've been getting lots of good feedback (and code!) from different people, with lots of new ideas and points for improvements.
So even if you are not a programmer, you can still help. This project is moving really fast because of all the help and comments I've received, notable mention goes to (in no particular order):

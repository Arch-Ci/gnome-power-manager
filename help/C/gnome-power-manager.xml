<!-- The revision numbering system for GNOME manuals is as follows: -->
<!-- * the revision number consists of two components -->
<!-- * the first component of the revision number reflects the release version of the GNOME desktop. -->
<!-- * the second component of the revision number is a decimal unit that is incremented with each revision of the manual. -->
<!-- For example, if the GNOME desktop release is V2.x, the first version of the manual that -->
<!-- is written in that desktop timeframe is V2.0, the second version of the manual is V2.1, etc. -->
<!-- When the desktop release version changes to V3.x, the revision number of the manual changes -->
<!-- to V3.0, and so on. -->

			      GNOME Power Manager
			   A Power Manager for GNOME

GNOME Power Manager is a GNOME session daemon that acts as a policy agent on top of 
the Project Utopia stack, which includes the kernel, hotplug, udev, and HAL. GNOME 
Power Manager listens for HAL events and responds with user-configurable reactions.
Currently it supports UPS's, laptop batteries and AC adapters. Its goal is to be 
architecture neutral and free of polling and other hacks.

Most of the code is actually in HAL for abstracting various power aware devices 
(UPS's) and frameworks (ACPI, PMU, APM etc.) - so the desktop parts are fairly 
lightweight and straightforward to write.

GNOME Power Manager comes in three parts:

	- gnome-power-manager:	    the manager daemon itself
	- gnome-power-preferences:  the control panel program, for configuration

To build, GNOME Power Manager requires

	- libgnomeui-2.0
	- libglade-2.0
	- libhal-0 (from HAL 0.5.2 or later)
	- libdbus-1 (from D-BUS 0.35 or later)
	- libdbus-glib-1 (from D-BUS 0.35 or later)
	- libnotify (from 0.0.1 or later)
	- notification-daemon (from 0.0.1 or later)

To run, gnome-power-manager requires hald to be running.

=== Failing to install gconf schema? ===

The amended configure line is needed when installing to a local gconf root (non root)
./configure --prefix=/home/hughsie/root --with-gconf-source=xml::/home/hughsie/.gconf

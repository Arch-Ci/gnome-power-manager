== Indent ==

As with most GNOME projects, use "indent -kr -i8 -pcs -lps -psl *.c" to 
convert to "mostly correct" indenting levels.

== Tabs ==

Tabs are the size of 8 spaces, and should be used in preference to spaces.
Overlong lines:

Functions that are two long for one line are intented with tabs and then 
spaces to the start of the bracket:

libnotify_event ("HAL does not have PowerManagement capability",
		 LIBNOTIFY_URGENCY_CRITICAL, NULL);

== Braces ==

Functions have curly brace on same line:

if (! true) {
	g_warning ("Cannot find icon");
	return FALSE;
}

Braces not-ommitted for single line:

if (! true) {
	g_warning ("Cannot find icon");
}

== Doxygen ==

Please use Doxygen markup with the following tab structure:

/** glib libhal replacement to get boolean type
 *
 *  @param	key		The key to query
 *  @return			TRUE for success, FALSE for failure
 */
